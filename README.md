## <Overview of Consolidated Profit and Loss (IFRS Basis)>

In the first quarter of 2025, sales revenue was 288.5 billion yen (up 21.8% year-over-year), operating income was 136.7 billion yen (up 36.8% year-over-year), and quarterly profit was 97.2 billion yen (up 30.6% year-over-year). These figures include amortization of intangible assets of 0.4 billion yen, impairment loss on intangible assets of 0.1 billion yen, business restructuring costs of 2.2 billion yen, and costs related to the reorganization of business sites of 0.1 billion yen, which are excluded from the Company’s core performance.

## <Overview of Consolidated Profit and Loss (Core Basis)>

In the first quarter of 2025, sales revenue was 288.5 billion yen (up 21.8% year-over-year), mainly due to an increase in product sales despite a decrease in other sales revenue.

Product sales were 259.7 billion yen (up 27.0% year-over-year). Domestic product sales remained at the same level as the previous year due to the impact of drug price revisions and the expansion of generic drugs, although new products such as Fesgo and Piasca and the flagship product Babysmo performed well. Overseas product sales significantly exceeded the previous year, driven by substantial increases in Hemlibra and Actemra exports to Roche.

Other sales revenue was 28.7 billion yen (down 11.7% year-over-year), due to an increase in Hemlibra-related revenue but a decrease in one-time income and other factors.

The product cost ratio improved by 1.8 percentage points year-over-year to 33.7%, mainly due to changes in the product sales composition ratio. As a result, gross profit was 201.0 billion yen (up 22.3% year-over-year).

## **Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (4519) 2025/12 Quarterly Earnings Report (1st Quarter)**


Research and development expenses were 40.7 billion yen (down 1.2% year-over-year), and selling, general, and administrative expenses were 21.0 billion yen (down 0.9% year-over-year), both similar to the same period last year. Other operating income (expenses) was 300 million yen in income (200 million yen in income in the same period last year). As a result, Core operating profit was 139.5 billion yen (up 36.6% year-over-year), and Core quarterly profit was 99.2 billion yen (up 30.5% year-over-year).


## *About Core Performance

The Company has been disclosing Core performance since 2013, following the transition to IFRS. Core performance is adjusted for items that the Company considers non-recurring, based on IFRS performance. Note that the Company's judgment on non-recurring items may differ from Roche's due to differences in business scale and scope. The Company uses Core performance as an indicator for internal performance management, explaining the trend of ordinary profitability to stakeholders, and for performance-based distribution, including shareholder returns.

For details, please refer to the 2025/12 1st Quarter Consolidated Financial Results (IFRS) Supplementary Materials (hereinafter referred to as the "Supplementary Materials") dated April 24, 2025, p. 1 "IFRS Performance to Core Performance Adjustment Table."

## [Domestic Pharmaceutical Product Sales]

Domestic pharmaceutical product sales were 103.0 billion yen (down 0.2% year-over-year), as new products and mainstay products grew, but were affected by price revisions and the spread of generic drugs.

Oncology sales were 53.1 billion yen (down 5.3% year-over-year). Although sales of the new anti-cancer agent/anti-HER2 humanized monoclonal antibody/hyaluronidase combination "Fesgo" were favorable, sales of mainstay products such as the anti-cancer agent/anti-VEGF humanized monoclonal antibody "Avastin" decreased due to price revisions and the spread of generic drugs. Additionally, sales of the anti-cancer agent/anti-HER2 humanized monoclonal antibody "Perjeta" significantly decreased from the same period last year, mainly due to the market penetration of "Fesgo," a combination subcutaneous injection formulation containing this drug.

Specialty sales were 49.9 billion yen (up 6.2% year-over-year). Despite being affected by price revisions and the spread of generic drugs, sales of the mainstay ophthalmic VEGF/Ang-2 inhibitor/anti-VEGF/anti-Ang-2 humanized bispecific monoclonal antibody "Beovu" were favorable, and the new pH-dependent binding humanized anti-complement (C5) monoclonal antibody "PiaSky" showed favorable market penetration. Furthermore, sales of the anti-influenza virus agent "Tamiflu" increased.


## [Overseas Pharmaceutical Product Sales]

Overseas pharmaceutical product sales were 156.7 billion yen (up 54.7% year-over-year). Exports to Roche significantly increased, driven by the blood coagulation factor II functional replacement agent/anti-blood coagulation factor Ia/X factor humanized bispecific monoclonal antibody "Hemlibra" and the humanized anti-human IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody "Actemra."

The Net Operating Assets (NOA) at the end of the first quarter of 2025 decreased by 18.9 billion yen from the end of the previous fiscal year to 928.7 billion yen. 
The net working capital decreased by 41.7 billion yen from the end of the previous fiscal year to 407.0 billion yen, mainly due to a decrease in accounts receivable due to the settlement of royalties and a decrease in inventories. 
Long-term net operating assets increased by 22.8 billion yen from the end of the previous fiscal year to 521.7 billion yen, mainly due to investments in the biopharmaceutical manufacturing building (UT3) and the injection building (UTA) at the Utsunomiya factory.

As shown in the next section, "Cash Flow Situation," net cash, including securities and interest-bearing debt, decreased by 51.7 billion yen from the end of the previous fiscal year to 944.6 billion yen. 
Other net non-operating assets increased by 76.4 billion yen from the end of the previous fiscal year to 33.9 billion yen, mainly due to a decrease in accrued corporate income tax.

As a result, total net assets increased by 5.7 billion yen from the end of the previous fiscal year to 1,907.2 billion yen.


##### *About Net Operating Assets (NOA) and Net Assets

The consolidated statement of financial position is prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 1 "Presentation of Financial Statements." 
On the other hand, Net Operating Assets (NOA) and Net Assets are reconfigured from the consolidated statement of financial position as internal management indicators, and Roche also discloses similar indicators. 
Note that there are no exclusion items like Core performance in Net Operating Assets (NOA) and Net Assets.

For details, please refer to the supplementary materials, page 8, "Financial Position."


##### *About Net Operating Assets (NOA)

Net Operating Assets (NOA) enables the evaluation of the Company's group performance independently of financial transactions and tax transactions.

### Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (4519) 
### Quarterly Financial Report for the First Quarter of the Fiscal Year Ending December 2025


#### (5) Notes on Going Concern

There are no relevant matters.


#### (6) Notes on Summary Quarterly Consolidated Financial Statements


#### 1 Significant Accounting Policies, etc.


##### (a) Basis of Preparation

These summary quarterly consolidated financial statements are for Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., a company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (stock code: 4519), and its subsidiaries, based in Japan (Tokyo). These statements were approved by the Board of Directors on April 24, 2025.

Roche Holding Ltd. is a Swiss stock exchange-listed company and the parent company of the Roche Group, which reports its performance in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Our group has been a major member of the Roche Group since October 2002, following the conclusion of a strategic alliance with Roche. Roche Holding Ltd. owns 59.89% of our total issued shares (61.11% when treasury shares are excluded).

Our group prepares these summary quarterly consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Quarterly Financial Statements Preparation Standards of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Article 5, Paragraph 2 (however, some disclosures required by International Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" have been omitted based on Article 5, Paragraph 5 of the same standards). 

These summary quarterly consolidated financial statements do not include all the information required for annual consolidated financial statements; therefore, they should be used in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the previous fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.

The summary quarterly consolidated financial statements are presented in Japanese yen, our functional currency, and amounts less than one million yen have been rounded off. Measurements are based on historical cost, except for certain items that require measurement at fair value.


#### (b) Significant Accounting Judgments, Estimates, and Assumptions

The preparation of these summary quarterly consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingent events. These estimates may differ from actual results. Estimates and underlying assumptions are based on past experiences and various factors and are continuously reviewed. Changes in estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the change occurs.

Information on judgments, estimates, and assumptions that have a significant impact on the amounts recognized in our group's summary quarterly consolidated financial statements is generally consistent with that of the previous fiscal year.


#### (c) Changes in Accounting Policies

The significant accounting policies applied to our group's summary quarterly consolidated financial statements are the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the previous fiscal year.

There were minor changes in some standards, but they did not have a significant impact on our group's performance or financial position.
