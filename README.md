#### 2: History<table><tr><td>History of Organization</td><td>The Company was founded in March 1960 in Minato-ku, Tokyo, as "University Newspaper Advertising Agency," the predecessor of Recruit Holdings Co., Ltd., with the goal of publishing job advertisements for various companies in university newspapers. Subsequently, the Company entered into a contract to handle advertisements for multiple university newspapers and established University Advertising Co., Ltd. in October 1960. In 1962, the Company launched "Invitation to Companies." In April 1963, the Company changed its name to Japan Recruit Co., Ltd. and established the current company, Japan Recruit Center Co., Ltd., in August of the same year. (For the subsequent history of the organization, please refer to the timeline.)</td></tr><tr><td>Expansion of Business Areas</td><td>Founded in 1960 as a specialized advertising agency for university newspapers, the Company published "Invitation to Companies," which collected job information for university students, two years later, establishing a business model called the "Ribbon Model" that connected individual users and corporate clients. In addition to expanding its human resources-related business, such as mid-career recruitment, human resources introduction, and temporary staffing, the Company expanded its business into areas such as school advancement, housing, used cars, marriage, and other life event areas, as well as daily consumer areas such as travel, food, and beauty. In recent years, the Company has expanded its business area to include business and operational support services for small and medium-sized corporate clients, including retail and restaurant stores, using SaaS (Software as a Service).</td></tr><tr><td>Digitalization of Information</td><td>The Company has introduced computers since a time when their adoption was rare and has continued to practice digitalization of information to expedite and streamline its operations. After researching supercomputers in the 1980s, the Company shifted from paper media (information magazines) to the Internet and mobile devices in the 1990s. Not only did this enable the Company to deliver information more easily and quickly, but it also developed innovative online reservation management systems and provided overwhelming convenience to individual users and corporate clients through digitalization of information. The Company is accelerating the expansion of its cloud-based SaaS solutions.</td></tr><tr><td>Globalization</td><td>The Company began to expand its business into the global market in the 2000s, initially launching a marriage-related business in China but withdrew several years later. However, this experience was utilized in its subsequent M&A-based overseas business strategy, and after acquiring The CSI Companies, Inc. in the United States, the Company accelerated its acquisitions in the temporary staffing business. While working to improve the productivity of the acquired organizations, the Company expanded its business to countries and regions around the world, including Europe and Australia. The acquisitions of Indeed, Inc. in 2012 and Glassdoor LLC in 2018 added the HR Technology business, driving the growth of the entire Group. The Company's services are now available in over 60 countries and regions.</td></tr><tr><td>Evolution as a Matching Platform</td><td>The Company has evolved its advertising-based media business into a marketplace business model that provides more optimal matching solutions for both individual users and corporate clients using technology. In the HR Technology business and temporary staffing business, the Company aims to simplify the recruitment process and provide further value to job seekers and companies under the "Simplify Hiring" strategy. In the Marketing, Matching & Technology business, the Company is building an ecosystem that supports the business operations of corporate clients with matching platforms and SaaS under the "Help Businesses Work Smarter" strategy, aiming to improve the productivity and profitability of corporate clients. The Company is also focusing on further improving the efficiency and speed of matching by utilizing AI developed by leveraging its accumulated experience.</td></tr></table>- 5 -
