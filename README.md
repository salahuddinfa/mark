# A  Accounting principles and application of alternative performance measures (APM)

## A1  General accounting principles and new accounting rules

### Reading instructions
General accounting principles and new accounting rules are §  presented below. Other accounting principles considered material by SCA are presented in conjunction with the respective note. The same principles are usually applied in both the Parent Company and the Group. In some cases, the Parent Company applies principles other than those used by the Group and, in such cases, these principles are specified under the respective note in the section about the Parent Company.

Key assessments and assumptions ! are presented under the respective notes. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS and generally accepted Swedish accounting principles requires assessments and assumptions that affect recognized asset and liability items, income and expense items, as well as other information disclosed. These assessments and assumptions, which also includes estimates based on, amongst other, chosen valuation models, are often based on historical experience, but also on other factors, including expectations of future events. With other assessments and assumptions, the result may be different and the actual result will seldom fully concur with the estimated result.

The areas that SCA considers to be impacted the most by assessments and assumptions are:
• Segment reporting and revenue from contracts with customers, Note B1.
• Remuneration after completion of employment, Note C5.
• Forest assets, Note D3.

Amounts that are reconcilable to the income statement, balance sheet, comprehensive income, equity and cash flow statement and tables in notes are marked with the following symbols.

| IS | Consolidated income statement. |
| OCI | Consolidated statement of comprehensive income. |
| EQ | Consolidated statement of change in equity. |
| BS | Consolidated balance sheet. |
| CF | Consolidated cash flow statement. |
| XX:X | Reference to table in note. |

### Basis for preparation
The SCA Group's financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Accounting Standards (IAS), as adopted within the EU, and the Swedish Financial Reporting Board, Recommendation RFR 1 Supplementary Accounting Rules for Groups. The Parent Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with RFR 2, Reporting by Legal Entities, and the Annual Accounts Act. The accounts for both the Group and the Parent Company relate to the fiscal year that ended on December 31, 2023. Biological assets measured at fair value in the income statement. Land assets attributable to forest assets are measured at fair value in other comprehensive income. In the Parent Company, biological assets are not measured at fair value, but at historical cost.

### Changes to accounting principles
The following standards and changes were applied by the Group for the first time for the first fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2023:
• Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors
• Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a single transaction.
• IAS 12 Income Taxes: International Tax Reform – Pillar 2 Model Rules – amendments.
• Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.

The amendments have not had a material impact on the carrying amount. For information linked to Pillar 2, see Note B5.

### Principles of consolidation
The Group's financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Group's accounting principles and include the accounts of the Parent Company and all Group companies.

### Subsidiaries
All companies over which the Group has a controlling influence are consolidated as subsidiaries.

### Translation of foreign currency
#### Functional currency and translation of foreign Group companies to the presentation currency
SCA's Parent Company has Swedish kronor (SEK) as its functional currency. The financial statements of Group companies are translated to the Group's presentation currency, which is SEK in the case of SCA.
Exchange rate effects arising from financial instruments used to hedge foreign subsidiaries' net assets are recognized in other comprehensive income, which is a component of translation reserves in equity.

#### Transactions and balance sheet items in foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currency are translated to a functional currency using the rate prevailing on the transaction date. In cases where the exchange rate effect is related to the operations, the effect is recognized net in operating profit. Exchange rate effects pertaining to borrowing and financial investments are recognized as other financial items. Non-monetary assets and liabilities recognized at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date.

If hedge accounting has been applied, for example, for cash flow hedges or hedging of net investments, the exchange rate effect is recognized in equity under other comprehensive income.
For financial assets in the form of equity instruments that are not held for trading, the portion of the value change pertaining to currency is recognized in the income statement. Any other unrealized change is recognized in equity under other comprehensive income.

### Revenue recognition
Sales revenue, which is synonymous with net sales, includes the consideration for goods and services sold within the Group's main business. This consists entirely of revenue from contracts with customers and is recognized in accordance with IFRS 15. Other operating income includes income from SCA's transport activities, income from the sale of forest seedlings, gravel, district heating, electricity, guarantees of origin pertaining to wind power, tall oil and wood pellets, revenue from leases, land lease income from wind power, hunting and fishing rights, and capital gains from the sale of non-current assets. Most other operating income consists of revenue from contracts with customers and is recognized in accordance with IFRS 15. Income from electricity certificates, emission allowances and guarantees of origin from pulp mills is recognized as reduced energy costs. Dividends received are recognized when the right to receive a dividend has been established.

### Government grants
Government grants related to acquisition of assets are recognized in the balance sheet by the grant reducing the carrying amount of the asset. Government grants received as compensation for costs are accrued and recognized in the income statement as a cost reduction during the same period as the costs. If the government grant is neither related to the acquisition of assets nor to compensation for costs, the grant is recognized as other income. For more information about government grants, refer to Notes B2, B4 and D2.

### Climate-related risks and opportunities
SCA sees both risks and opportunities linked to a changed climate and measures to counteract or adapt operations to expected climate change. Identifying and managing these risks are integrated into the company's risk process. SCA has analyzed climate-related risks and opportunities using two alternative scenarios, one scenario with low future emissions and one scenario with high future emissions, refer to the risk section in the Board of Directors' Report. Negative impacts could be increased costs or reduced opportunities to conduct forest operations and thus lower harvesting rates. Positive opportunities could be greater demand for renewable materials and renewable energy.

The expected physical climate change is deemed to have the greatest impact on the development of the forest holding and conditions for forest operations and is currently considered to be related to more frequent extreme weather conditions, increased risk of infestation and a longer growing season. Transition risks, such as political decisions, could have a positive or negative impact on the company. Positive or negative impacts were identified in the following areas and are discussed under each note:
Measurement of assets, see Notes D1 and D2.
Measurement of forest assets, see Note D3.
Access to and terms of financing, see Note E4.

# B Sales and earnings

## B1 Segment reporting and revenue from contracts with customers

### ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

**Segments**  
Segments are recognized in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments in a manner that complies with the internal reporting submitted to the chief operating decision maker, which in SCA's case is the company's President and CEO. The President and CEO is responsible for allocating resources and assessing the result of the operating segments. The Executive Management supports the President and CEO in his work, see the section Corporate governance in the Board of Directors' Report on pages 76–87.

A description of the five operating segments can be found on pages 34–57.

**Revenue from contracts with customers**  
SCA applies IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers. SCA's contracts with customers are mainly framework agreements without established minimum volumes, which means a binding agreement in accordance with the criteria specified in IFRS 15 arises when the customer makes a call-off order. SCA's performance obligation in the contracts consists of providing the goods specified in the contracts.

SCA is of the opinion that control is transferred to the customer at the same time as the risk for the goods is transferred, in accordance with the Incoterms applicable in the contract. SCA applies the Delivered At Place (DAP) terms for 56% (53) of sales revenues, meaning risk is transferred when the goods are made available to the customer at the agreed destination. For other freight terms applied, the risk is transferred when the goods are loaded on to the vessel or other freight vehicles. Payment terms follow industry practice without long credit periods.

The transaction price primarily consists of a fixed price per sold quantity. Variable parts, such as cash discounts, volume discounts and delivery bonuses, reduce the transaction price. The transaction price is estimated at the value that is expected to accrue to SCA when entering into the agreement. The transaction price is continuously updated if the circumstances that form the basis of the estimate change. Performance obligations consist of sales of goods, which are satisfied at a point in time.

### KEY ASSESSMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS

SCA has determined that all revenue recognized as net sales and other operating income pertaining to goods and services constitute revenue from contracts with customers. Net sales comprise the sales of goods. Other operating income comprises the sales of goods and services.

# Intra-Group deliveries
Revenues, expenses and results for the various operating segments were affected by intra-Group deliveries. Internal prices are market-based.

## Operating segments
SCA recognizes five operating segments in accordance with IFRS 8. Renewable Energy is a new segment from January 1, 2023. Comparative figures have been restated.

The Forest segment includes the supply of raw material to SCA's industries as well as management and harvesting on SCA-owned forest land, which comprises 2.7 million hectares in northern Sweden and the Baltic region. The segment also includes sourcing timber from other forest owners and transporting the timber to SCA's industries.

The Wood segment includes the solid-wood business with five sawmills in northern Sweden and wood processing and distribution to the building materials trade in Sweden and France.

The Pulp segment encompasses the production and sale of bleached softwood kraft pulp (NBSK) and chemi-thermomechanical pulp (CTMP), which are produced at the Östrand pulp mill and Ortviken site. The Östrand pulp mill is also a net producer of green energy and biochemicals such as tall oil and turpentine.

The Containerboard segment manufactures and sells packaging paper (kraftliner), with production at the integrated paper mills in Obbola and Munksund.

The Renewable Energy segment encompasses production and sales of refined and unrefined biofuels as well as liquid biofuels. The segment also includes development and revenue linked to the wind power operations and sales of green products from industrial operations for energy production.

# B5	Taxes

## ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

The Group's tax expense comprises current tax and deferred tax. Current tax includes adjustments relating to recognized current tax from other periods. Interest attributable to income tax is also recognized as income tax.

SCA does not recognize tax that may arise on future dividends of the retained earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Any such future effects (withholding tax deducted at source and other deferred tax on profit-taking within the Group) are recognized when SCA can no longer control the reversal of such differences or when, for other reasons, it is probable that a reversal can take place in the foreseeable future.

Tax liabilities and tax assets are recognized net when SCA has a legal right to offset.

The Group is subject to the OECD's model rules and the EU directive for Pillar 2. Legislation relating to this was adopted in Sweden, where SCA is based, and took effect on January 1, 2024. Legislation concerning Pillar 2 had not gained legal force on the balance sheet date and consequently the Group has no related current tax to take into account. The Group applies the exemption to reporting and providing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to income tax from Pillar 2, as presented in the amendments to IAS 12 that were issued in May 2023 and adopted by the EU in November 2023. For further information, refer to the "disclosures relating to top-up tax for large multinational enterprises (Pillar 2)" on the following page.

## KEY ASSESSMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS

The Group conducts operations in several countries, which increases the complexity when determining deferred tax assets and tax liabilities. This requires that assessments and assumptions are made to determine the value of the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability on the balance sheet date. Future changes to taxation legislation and trends in the business climate will impact the company's future taxable profits and thus its possibility to utilize deferred tax assets on loss carryforwards and other temporary differences.

As of December 31, 2023, SEK 45m (22) was recognized as deferred tax assets based on best assessment of future taxable profits in the Group. At year-end 2023, the Group also had tax loss carryforwards of SEK 24m (35), for which no deferred tax asset had been recognized. Accordingly, a changed assessment of the probability of future taxable profits could have a positive or negative effect. In SCA's opinion, at the end of 2023 there were no material uncertain tax items in the financial statements which could result in a significant adjustment of the reported values during forthcoming fiscal years.

Key assessments and assumptions are also made regarding recognition of provisions and contingent liabilities relating to tax risks. For further information, refer to Note G1.

# Loss carryforwards
Future tax credits and loss carryforwards for which deferred tax assets were recognized have been reported at the tax amount of SEK –22m on the line future tax credits and tax loss carryforwards in table B5:3. Loss carryforwards for which no deferred tax assets were recognized amounted to SEK 24m (35), gross, at December 31, 2023, see table B5:4. The tax value of uncapitalized tax loss carryforwards amounted to SEK 5m (7). SCA considers it unlikely that loss carryforwards for which no deferred tax was recognized will be offset against future profits as these largely concern saved capital losses with a limited right of deduction against future capital gains. The useful life of these loss carryforwards are distributed as shown in table B5:4.

# Information regarding top-up tax for large multinational enterprises (Pillar 2)
Legislation concerning Pillar 2 was adopted by Sweden on December 13, 2023. Under the legislation, SCA is required to pay top-up tax for the difference between the effective tax rate calculated using the GloBE rules for each jurisdiction and the minimum effective tax rate of 15%.

The Group is currently assessing its exposure to top-up tax under Pillar 2. This assessment used country-by-country reporting for 2021 and 2022, though SCA expects the result to also be representative for 2023 and 2024. Part of the Group's work is to ensure that the data source used in its country-by-country reports is considered a qualified financial report under the legislation.

This assessment indicates that the Group will be able to utilize the ­temporary simplification rules in all countries where SCA operates, with the exception of Estonia and Latvia. These countries are, however, subject to separate rules regarding approved dividend tax systems whereby fictitious dividend tax amounts may be credited and through which the Group expects to achieve the minimum effective tax rate. Consequently, no material exposure is expected to top-up tax.

The Group notes that its operations in Hong Kong are subject to a nominal tax rate that is close to the minimum effective tax rate of 15% and that certain exposure may exist with respect to 2024. Earnings in Hong Kong only represent a small portion of the Group's earnings, so possible exposure is not expected to result in any material amounts.

Due to the complexity of applying the legislation and in calculating GloBE income, the quantitative effect of the adopted legislation is difficult to assess. The Group is currently working with tax specialists who are assisting in applying the legislation and evaluating the impact should the Group be unable to use the temporary simplification rules.

## C3 Remuneration of senior executives

### Guidelines for remuneration of senior executives 
These guidelines were adopted by the 2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM) and shall thereafter apply to remuneration to Board members, the President and CEO, vice President as well as other members of the senior management. The guidelines do not apply to remuneration resolved by the general meeting.

### Principles for remuneration 
A prerequisite for the successful implementation of the company's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests, including its sustainability, is that the company is able to recruit, motivate and retain qualified personnel through competitive remuneration in line with market levels. To this end, the total remuneration is to correspond to market practice and be competitive on the senior manager's field of profession, as well as being linked to the manager's responsibility, authority and performance. Remuneration may consist of fixed salary, variable salary, other benefits and pension, jointly referred to as total remuneration. The company's business strategy is available on pages 30–33.

### Variable remuneration 
Variable remuneration shall aim at promoting the company's business strategy and long-term interests, including its sustainability. Variable remuneration shall be based on the outcome in relation to short-term and long-term goals, respectively, comprising financial goals, goals that contribute to such (including sustainability goals), or to the value development of the company's Class B share. It shall be linked to the fixed annual salary and be maximized. Variable remuneration is to be paid as cash remuneration and shall not qualify for pension benefits. 

Short-term performance goals may include, for example, organic growth, profit, cash flow, capital efficiency, return, health-safety-environment, individual targets, or a combination thereof. Remuneration that may be paid under such short-term performance goals shall not exceed 100% of the fixed annual salary. 

Long-term performance goals shall be linked to the value development of the company's Class B share and the company's increased climate benefit. Remuneration that may be paid under such long-term performance goals, including performance period, maximum amount and other main conditions, shall therefore be approved by the general meeting. 

Total variable remuneration related to short-term performance goals and long-term performance goals in accordance with the description above shall not exceed 100% of the fixed annual salary. 

Additionally, variable remuneration in the form of project bonus may be awarded in individual cases. The performance goals shall, in such cases, be linked to the project (e.g. CAPEX or production volume) in order to promote the completion of the project. The achievement of goals is measured, and bonus may be paid, after one or several years. Such project bonus shall not exceed 40% of the total fixed annual salary during the relevant period. The company shall be able to refrain from paying variable remuneration when required and possible under applicable law, if there is special cause and withholding the payment is necessary to serve the company's long-term interests, including its sustainability.

The company shall also have the possibility to, under applicable law, reclaim variable remuneration paid on incorrect grounds.

### Pension and other benefits 
Pension benefits shall solely contain defined contribution pension benefits, unless the manager is subject to defined benefit pension under applicable collective agreement provisions. The planned retirement age is 65 years. The defined contribution pension shall amount to a maximum of 50% of the fixed annual salary. 

Other benefits may include, for example, health insurance, company car and wellness allowance. 

In the event of termination of employment, a notice period of no longer than two years shall apply if termination is initiated by the company, or no longer than one year, if termination is initiated by the senior executive. There will be no severance pay.

### Decision-making process and reporting 
Issues regarding remuneration to senior executives shall be dealt with by the Board of Directors' Remuneration Committee and, in case of the President and CEO, be decided by the Board of Directors. The Remuneration Committee's tasks shall also include preparing the Board of Directors' decision to propose guidelines for remuneration to senior executives, as well as monitoring and evaluating the application of these. The senior executives shall not participate in the Board of Directors' nor the Remuneration Committee's discussions of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters. 

In the preparation of the remuneration guidelines, salary and employment conditions for the company's other employees in Sweden shall be taken into account, including information on the employees' total income, the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time, as well as the company's equality policy. The Board of Directors shall prepare a remuneration report.

### Application of and deviation from the guidelines 
The Board of Directors may temporarily decide to deviate from the guidelines, in whole or in part, if in a specific case there is special cause for the deviation and a deviation is necessary to serve the company's long-term interests, including its sustainability. 

The guidelines do not take precedence over mandatory provisions under applicable employment regulation or collective agreements. In addition, they are not applicable to agreements already signed.

### Application of guidelines for remuneration of senior executives 2023
In 2023, the company has complied with the applicable remuneration guidelines as adopted by the Annual General Meeting. No deviations were made from the guidelines, nor were any deviations made from the decision-making process with regard to the determination of remuneration stated in the guidelines. The auditor statement on the company's compliance with the guidelines is available on sca.com. There were no demands to repay remuneration.

# Fixed salary
The fixed salary has been linked to the senior executive's responsibility and authority. Salaries have been decided on an individual basis to a level, using an overall assessment of the executive's total remuneration, that was deemed competitive and corresponds to market practice in the executive's field of profession.

# Variable remuneration
The President and CEO and other senior executives were part of SCA's program for variable remuneration where remuneration is paid according to SCA's provisions. The total variable remuneration could, for the President and CEO, amount to a maximum of 100% of fixed salary while the variable remuneration for other senior executives could amount to a maximum of 80% of fixed salary. Variable remuneration was divided into a short-term and long-term portion.

The short-term variable remuneration (Short Term Incentive, STI) could, for the President and CEO, amount to a maximum of 50% of the fixed salary and for other senior executives to 40% of the fixed salary. The established STI targets in 2023 for the President and CEO and CFO comprised the Group's EBITDA, profit for the year, operating cash flow, industrial return on capital employed as well as development relating to the number of workplace accidents that result in lost time accidents (LTAs). For senior executives with Central Staff functions, the Manager for the support unit Sourcing & Logistics and for the Business Area Manager of Forest, the STI targets comprised the Group's EBITDA, operating cash flow, industrial return on capital employed as well as development relating to the number of workplace accidents that result in LTAs. For the Wood, Pulp, Containerboard and Renewable Energy business area presidents, the STI targets in addition to Group-wide targets relate to EBITDA, operating cash flow, industrial return on capital employed for each segment. For the Renewable Energy business area, the return target consisted of return on capital employed and also included wind power.

The long-term portion (Long Term Incentive, LTI) could, for the President and CEO, amount to a maximum of 50% of fixed salary and for other senior executives to 40% of fixed salary, where all of the net outcome (after tax deductions) is to be used to buy Class B shares in SCA. The acquired shares may then not be sold within three years of the purchase. In 2023, SCA had two outstanding long term cash-based incentive programs, LTI 2022–2024 and LTI 2023–2025.

The performance criteria for LTI 2022–2024 comprise a financial target related to the total shareholder return (TSR) of the company's Class B share during the 2022–2024 fiscal years, which shall be measured as 60% in comparison with a peer group of other companies and as 40% in relation to the OMXS30 index (the TSR condition), as well as a sustainability target related to increased climate benefit (million tonnes of CO2 equivalents,) during the performance period (the Sustainability condition). The TSR condition will be weighted 90% and the Sustainability Condition 10% when payment of the cash remuneration is decided. One prerequisite for payment under the TSR condition is that the TSR of the company's class B share does not fall below the weighted TSR outcome for the peer group and the OMXS30 index during the performance period. The maximum outcome requires the performance target (TSR) for the company to be 5% better than the outcome for the peer group and that the average annual climate benefit must increase by 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents during the performance period compared with the average annual climate benefit during the 2019–2021 fiscal years. The evaluation period for the program covers the fiscal years 2022–2024. Payment of cash remuneration under the program can therefore not be made until 2025.

The performance criteria for LTI 2023–2025 comprise a financial target related to the total shareholder return (TSR) of the company's Class B share during the 2023–2025 fiscal years, which shall be measured as 60% in comparison with a peer group of other companies and as 40% in relation to the OMXS30GI index (the TSR condition), as well as a sustainability target related to increased climate benefit (million tonnes of CO2 equivalents,) during the performance period (the Sustainability condition). The TSR condition will be weighted 90% and the Sustainability Condition 10% when payment of the cash remuneration is decided. One prerequisite for payment under the TSR condition is that the TSR of the company's class B share does not fall below the weighted TSR outcome for the peer group and the OMXS30GI index during the performance period. The maximum outcome requires the performance target (TSR) for the company to be 5% better than the outcome for the peer group and that the average annual climate benefit must increase by 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents during the performance period compared with the average annual climate benefit during the 2020–2022 fiscal years. The evaluation period for the program covers the fiscal years 2023–2025. Payment of cash remuneration under the program can therefore not be made until 2026.

For both the outstanding LTI programs, climate benefit is calculated using the model published in 2019, see page 155.

# Supplementary variable program
For 2023, the Board of Directors resolved that the STI program should be supplemented with an additional short-term program. The supplementary program is intended to act as a transition to LTI 2022–2024, which matures in 2025.

The targets in the supplementary short-term incentive program are solely financial and consist of EBITDA, operating cash flow and industrial return on capital employed.

The supplementary short-term variable portion could, for the President and CEO, amount to a maximum of 50% of the fixed salary and for other senior executives to 40% of the fixed salary.

# Outcome, variable remuneration
For the President and CEO, STI resulted in 36.8% of the annual maximum STI payment for 2023. For other senior executives, STI resulted in 22.7–54.1% of the annual maximum STI payment for 2023. Payment from the supplementary STI program was equivalent to 36.7% of the maximum outcome. The President and CEO and other senior executives are entitled, as all Swedish white collar employees at SCA, to convert proceeds from variable pay programs into pension. This process is cost neutral for SCA.

# Pensions
The senior executives are covered by a defined contribution pension, where the company annually pays a premium of 40% of the fixed salary to the President and CEO and an annual premium of 30% of the fixed salary to other senior executives. The agreed pension premium for the President and CEO and other senior executives is paid as long as they are employed, though not longer than the month before the month the senior executive reaches the age of 65.

# Other benefits
Other benefits pertained to company cars and any other agreed benefits.

# Notice period and severance pay
The agreement with the President and CEO stipulates a period of notice of 24 months if such notice is given by the company and a period of notice of 6 months if notice is given by the President and CEO. If notice is given by the company, the President and CEO is obligated to be available to the company during the notice period if so requested by the company. If the President and CEO, after written approval from the company, assumes a new position during the period of notice, unless otherwise agreed, the new salary will be deducted from the salary received during the notice period. The agreement does not contain any stipulations with regard to severance pay.

Other senior executives have a notice period, if such notice is given by the company, of 12 months, which after five years of service, from their latest employment, increases to 18 months. The executive's notice period toward the company is 6 months. If requested by the company, this executive is obligated to be available to the company during the notice period. Any new salary from other positions will be deducted from the salary received during the notice period. The agreements have no stipulations with regard to severance pay.

# Preparation and decision process for remuneration
During the year, the Remuneration Committee submitted recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding the principles for remuneration of Senior executives. The Board discussed the Remuneration Committee's proposal and decided on the basis of the Committee's recommendations. The remuneration of corporate management for the fiscal year was based on the Remuneration Committee's recommendation. Matters of remuneration of the President and CEO were resolved by the Board of Directors. The executives concerned did not participate in remuneration matters pertaining to themselves. When it was deemed necessary, the work of the Remuneration Committee was carried out with the support of external expertise. For information about the composition of the Remuneration Committee, see page 79.

# Current guidelines
The guidelines for determining salaries and other remuneration for senior executives as resolved by the 2022 AGM, apply until the 2026 AGM, unless significant changes are made before then.

# C5 Remuneration after completion of employment

## § ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

**Defined benefit pension plans**  
The defined benefit obligations are calculated annually by independent actuaries using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Calculation is based on actuarial assumptions. Actuarial assumptions comprise the company's best assessment of the variables that determine the final cost for providing the benefits. The obligation is measured at the present value of the anticipated future cash flows using a discount rate (refer to Key assessments and assumptions). Actuarial gains and losses (remeasurements) are recognized directly in equity under other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. The recognized cost for the defined benefit plans includes personnel costs, as well as net interest items. Net interest items comprise the discount rate calculated on the average net pension liability for the period, taking fee and remuneration payments into consideration. The difference between the calculated interest income (discount rate) on the plan assets and SCA's actual return on the plan assets is included in the remeasurement of the defined benefit net liability (net asset) recognized in equity under other comprehensive income.

Funded plans with net assets, meaning plans with assets exceeding obligations, are recognized as a financial non-current asset provided they are not limited by the asset ceiling in IAS 19 Employee Benefits. Other pension plans, which are not fully funded or unfunded, are recognized as Provisions for pensions.

In certain countries, pension payments are subject to taxes or fees. In such cases, these are included in the calculation of the obligation for the defined benefit pension plans. These taxes or fees are recognized as an expense in the income statement, except in cases where they are attributable to actuarial gains or losses, in which case they are recognized directly in equity under other comprehensive income, as are the actuarial gains or losses.

## ! KEY ASSESSMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS

The calculation of recognized expenses and provisions for defined benefit pension plans, where the size of the future compensation is unknown and payment will occur far in the future, is dependent on assumptions and assessments. The key assessments and assumptions include the discount rate, future salary increases, inflation and life expectancy. SCA determines the discount rate based primarily on AA-rated corporate bonds issued in the currency in which the payments will be made that match the duration of the obligations. If no such corporate bonds are available, government bonds or mortgage bonds are used. Inflation assumptions are based on a combination of central bank targets, implicit market expectations and long-term analyst forecasts. Assumptions regarding salary increases are based on market expectations and market research forecasts. Principal actuarial assumptions are presented in table C5:5. The sensitivity of the recognized provision with respect to key actuarial assumptions is described in table C5:6.

### Sweden
The ITP2 plan encompasses employees born before 1979 and is a defined benefit plan that provides retirement pension based on final salary. The ITP2 plan provides pension as a percentage of various salary intervals. The pension is reduced proportionately if the total period of service is less than 30 years. The ITP2 plan is managed by a fund, and the company may compensate itself using any surpluses in the plan assets.

### Other
There are a number of minor pension obligations in Germany and Sweden. Some of these plans are funded.

### Other disclosures
#### Multiemployer plans
SCA has obligations for disability and family pensions for salaried employees in Sweden, secured through insurance with the insurance company Alecta. These benefits are reported as defined contribution plans since there is no basis for allocating the obligations, plan assets and costs to the individual companies covered by the plan.

#### Budgeted contributions
The budgeted contributions for the company's defined benefit pension plans for 2024 were calculated at SEK 65m. Contributions for multi-employer plans for 2024 were calculated at SEK 3m.

# D	Operating assets and liabilities

## D1	Intangible fixed assets

### §   ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
**Other intangible fixed assets**  
Intangible assets include patents, licenses and other similar rights. 
Acquired assets of this type are recognized at cost and are amortized  
on a straight-line basis during their anticipated useful life, which varies 
between 3 and 20 years. 

Customer relations are measured at fair value at the time of the acquisi-
tion. The value of these customer relations is amortized over their esti-
mated useful life, which is considered to be between 3 and 15 years.

Research expenditure is recognized as an expense when incurred. 
Identifiable expenditure for development of new products and processes 
is capitalized to the extent it is expected to provide future economic 
benefits. In cases in which it is difficult to separate the research phase 
from the development phase in a project, the entire project is treated as 
research and expensed immediately. Capitalized expenditure is amor-
tized on a straight-line basis from the date when the asset is in a location 
and in the condition required to use it in the manner intended by 
management.

**Impairment testing**  
When testing for impairment, the assets are grouped in cash-generating 
units in accordance with SCA's operating segments in Note B1. The 
calculation of future cash flows is based on the strategic plans adopted 
by Executive Management for the next three years.

**Emission allowances and costs for carbon dioxide emissions**  
SCA participates in the European system for emission allowances and 
receives a permit to emit a specific volume of carbon dioxide (CO₂) during 
a calendar year for each operation where an environmental permit is 
required. Emission allowances relating to CO₂ emissions are recognized 
as an intangible asset and as deferred income (liability) when they are 
received. Emission allowances are received free of charge and measured 
and recognized at market value as of the date to which the allocation 
pertains. During the period, the initial liability for emission allowances 
received is dissolved over the income statement as income in pace with 
actual CO₂ emissions and meets the cancellation of the intangible asset 
from allocated emission allowances to the extent the allocation covers 
actual emissions. If the emission allowances received do not cover actual 
emissions, a provision is made for the deficit valued at the market value 
on the balance sheet date. Sales of surplus emission allowances are 
recognized as income on the delivery date when the dissolution of the 
corresponding liability and disposal of the corresponding intangible 
assets occurs.

If the market price of emission allowances on the balance sheet date 
is less than recognized cost, any surplus emission allowances that are 
not required to cover emissions made are impaired to the market price. 
In conjunction with this, the remaining part of the deferred income is 
recognized as income by a corresponding amount and therefore no net 
effect occurs in the income statement. The emission allowances are used 
as payment in the settlement with the Swedish state regarding liabilities 
for actual CO₂ emissions.

**Guarantees of origin**  
SCA receives guarantees of origin for the electricity produced by SCA's 
industries and wind farms. Guarantees of origin are recognized as an 
intangible asset and as deferred income (liability) equivalent to the pro-
duced volume for the current month at market value. Guarantees of origin 
can be sold, purchased or canceled. Sales of guarantees of origin are 
reported on the delivery date at selling price and the intangible asset and 
as deferred income (liability) reversed proportionately. In the event of can-
cellation for own use or when the validity period expires, the intangible 
asset is reversed and deferred income is reduced by a corresponding 
amount.

¹ As of 2023, guarantees of origin received are recognized both in the income statement and balance sheet. Previously, these were only reported in the income statement.

### Climate risks
As of 2024, the maritime sector will be included in the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS). There will be a gradual introduction of obligations. By 2027, it will be mandatory to compensate for 100% of the fossil emissions from both intra-European and non-European sea travel. Exemptions may be made for countries outside the EU where emissions coverage could be reduced to 50% under certain conditions. There will be no free allocation of emission allowances for maritime traffic, but SCA is expected to be able to reallocate emission allowances within the Group.

# D2 Tangible fixed assets

## § ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

The cost of properties and production facilities included in major projects includes costs for running-in and start-up. The sale of products from the running-in period is recognized as net sales. Borrowing costs are included in the cost of investments involving significant amounts that take more than 12 months to complete. Expenditure for repairs and maintenance is expensed directly in the income statement. Income from the sale of products manufactured during the completion of the facility are recognized over the income statement. In cases where an investment in foreign currency has been recognized using hedge accounting, the gain/loss from the hedge is recognized as part of the acquisition cost.

Land assets attributable to forest assets are recognized on a separate line in the balance sheet and are included in Note D3 Forest assets. For information on investment commitments in non-current assets, refer to Note G1 Segment reporting.

### Depreciation and impairment

Land is not subject to depreciation. Buildings, land improvements, machinery and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets. The remaining useful lives of assets that will be replaced in the transition to fossil-free manufacturing could be impacted. However, the conditions required to amend accounting estimates have not been met, for example, investment decisions are still pending. Nor have investments and other cash flow related to the transition been taken into account in impairment testing.

# D3 Forest assets

## ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

The total value of the forest assets is based on transactions in the areas where SCA owns forest assets. To support this valuation, SCA retrieves statistics of transactions, which are available from a number of market sources. Price statistics from transactions are multiplied by SCA's standing volume; the level of the standing volume is based on an inventory and simulated growth. A large number of forest transactions are conducted in areas where SCA owns forest assets, and the value of larger forest holdings is generally at the same level or higher compared with smaller and mid-sized forest assets per m³fo.

SCA uses inputs, which under IFRS 13 are recognized at various levels in the evaluation hierarchy, to measure its forest assets. The statistics obtained can be viewed as market-corroborated inputs in accordance with measurement level 2. However, the valuation of forest assets is entirely allocated to level 3, as the estimated forest volume contains assessments and the suppliers of the transaction data make certain adjustments using unobservable inputs (see KAA). No transfers have taken place between the measurement levels during the year.

The total value of SCA's forest assets is distributed between biological assets and land. To establish the value of biological assets a DCF-model (discounted cash flow) is used. When cash flow was discounted, a rate of return was used that reflects the yield requirement necessary so the discounted cash flows correspond to the total fair value according to the current market statistics. SCA also capitalizes replanting costs. The change in value is recognized in the income statement on the line for change in value in biological assets. Land assets relating to forest assets are recognized at fair value in accordance with IAS 16.31, and are recognized on a separate line in the balance sheet under forest assets. The change in value pertaining to land is recognized as other comprehensive income and does not impact profit for the year.

Climate-related risks are taken into account, for example, by considering environmental restrictions and other limitations which mean that the assets cannot be fully utilized. The effects of regulations as a result of known political decisions are taken into consideration. Demand for renewable raw materials and renewable energy is expected to increase and may have a positive impact on wood prices in the future. Changed climate conditions may lead to higher growth and in parallel increase the risk of infestation and extreme weather conditions. The impact of climate-related changes is difficult to assess since the cycles are long and entail both opportunities and risks. SCA manages this by conducting a sensitivity analysis (table D3:1) in the form of changed wood price, felling costs and volumes. The calculation is performed for a production cycle for biological assets that SCA estimated to average 100 years.

## KEY ASSESSMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS

The market statistics that form the basis for the valuation of forest assets relating to the Swedish forest holding are obtained from the providers Ludvig & Co and Svefa, which are two independent parties in relation to SCA. The providers process the data by adjusting market transactions that include other significant components in addition to forest land. Svefa also makes adjustments for forest land transactions under ten hectares. SCA makes no adjustments to data from Ludvig & Co and Svefa. On average, the suppliers completed 186 transactions in 2023 and SCA was a party in approximately 2% of the transactions. SCA uses the data to calculate a volume-weighted price on the basis of how the forest assets are distributed geographically.

SCA's timber stand in Sweden is inventoried at regular intervals (most recently in 2019). Between the inventories of the entire forest holding, forest growth is simulated each year based on the inventory. The simulation of SCA's growth is conducted by an external party. It is then fixed until the next inventory. In the Baltic region, SCA receives an estimate of growth from Norskog, which is an independent source in relation to SCA.

The calculated market price used by SCA is based on forest transactions over the last three years to obtain an accurate overall view as individual transactions will not have a major impact on the outcome. Since transactions may take several months to complete, there is no isolated market value given at December 31.

The Baltic holdings were previously measured at the same price per m³fo as the Swedish holdings. In 2023, SCA changed this assumption and used a three-year average market price based on completed forest transactions in the Baltic region. Market statistics of forest land prices in the Baltic region are mainly obtained from Norskog. Since available data for forest transactions in the Baltic region are less comprehensive than Swedish data, SCA uses another three data sources to determine the price used for measurement. These data sources are a DCF model from Norskog, SCA's own transactions in the Baltic region and data from transactions in northern Sweden.

The cash flow statements for 2023 took no account of climate change since its impact is considered to lie further in the future and will not impact the current model to any significant extent. SCA indicates possible effects of climate change by presenting a sensitivity analysis, which shows the effects of an increased timber inventory and harvesting volume. When cash flow was discounted, estimated income and expenses were adjusted by an annual inflation rate of 2%. The calculation to establish the value of biological assets is based on existing, sustainable harvesting plans and assessments regarding growth, timber prices, harvesting and silviculture costs, and selling expenses.

The three-year average price in 2023 was SEK 395/m³fo (366) and is used to determine the total average value per m³fo of SCA's forest assets in Sweden. The corresponding price for the Baltic region is EUR 40.5/m³fo (SEK 366). The distribution of forest assets is carried out according to the same principles in Sweden and the Baltic region and is based on the Swedish model. As of December 31, 2023, timber volume is estimated to amount to approximately 263 million m³fo in Sweden and approximately 8 million m³fo in the Baltic region.

The table (D3:1) describes the sensitivity of the carrying amount with respect to key assumptions.

# Distribution by country

| SEKm | 2023 | 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Forest assets in Sweden¹⁾ | 103,927 | 95,206 |
| Forest assets in the Baltic region²⁾ | 3,554 | 2,676 |
| Total value of biological assets and land assets | 107,481 | 97,882 |
| Deferred tax related to forest assets | 21,277 | 19,468 |

¹⁾ The fair value of SCA's forest assets in Sweden in 2023 was based on a timber volume of approximately 263 million m³fo multiplied by the market price of SEK 395/m³fo.
²⁾ The fair value of SCA's forest assets in the Baltic region in 2023 was based on a timber volume of approximately 8 million m³fo multiplied by the market price of EUR 40.5/m³fo (translated to SEK at the closing day rate).

## Value per hectare and forest cubic

| | 2023¹⁾ | 2022¹⁾ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Carrying amount SEK/hectare total forest assets | 51,176 | 47,585 |
| Carrying amount SEK/m³fo²⁾ | 395 | 366 |
| Carrying amount EUR/m³fo³⁾ | 40.5 | |

¹⁾ The values are calculated based on productive forest area.
²⁾ Applied to forest assets in Sweden
³⁾ Applied to forest assets in Baltic region. In 2022, SEK 366/m³fo was used.

The change in the fair value of biological assets and change due to felling are recognized as a net value in the income statement on the line change in value in biological assets. The change amounts to (IS) SEK 2,198m (1,825). Total change in value of biological assets amounts to SEK 2,533m (2,372).

The current year's valuation of biological assets and land assets was based on market statistics and discounted cash flows. For the current year's valuation of biological assets, the same valuation model was used as in the previous year using a yield requirement of 3.6% (3.5) after tax. The yield requirement for investments in forest assets reflects the forest's long cycles, and it is not affected by short-term variations in market rates.

Assumptions regarding future price and cost levels are based on the outcome for prior years adjusted for inflation. The valuation assumes an average wood price of SEK 528 (479) per solid cubic meter under bark (m³sub). Annual harvesting in 2023 was 5.0 (4.4) million m³sub and is expected to rise over the future production cycle. On average, 87% of harvesting is final felling and 13% thinning. Of this, 48% is expected on average over the years to comprise sawlogs and 52% pulpwood.

SCA's forest holdings in Sweden are made up of approximately 2.6 million hectares of forest assets primarily in northern Sweden, of which approximately 2.0 million is productive forest land. SCA also owns just over 62,000 hectares of forest land and 11,000 hectares of other land that can potentially be converted to forest land or be sold in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Growth amounts to approximately 10.9 million m³fo per year, gross, on productive forest area. Net growth, meaning growth after harvesting and natural losses, is estimated to have averaged 3.5 million m³fo per year in Sweden and 0.3 million m³fo per year in the Baltic region.

# TABLE D3:1 Sensitivity analysis¹⁾

| SEKm | Change in assumption | Change in value, before tax |  |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| | | 2023 | 2022 |
| **Total forest assets** | | | |
| Market price based on market statistics | Price change 5% on a total volume of 271 (267) million m³fo | 5,374 | 4,894 |
| Forest holding's standing timber volume²⁾ | 3 million m³fo (approx. 1%) | 1,185 | 1,099 |
| **Biological assets as a share of forest assets³⁾** | | | |
| Discount rate | Reduction by 0.1% | 2,234 | 2,188 |
| Wood price | Increase of 10% | 12,291 | 11,584 |
| Felling cost | Increase of 10% | -3,383 | -3,179 |
| Volume harvested | Increase of 10% | 6,008 | 5,749 |

¹⁾ The effects of climate change are difficult to predict and SCA chose a few parameters for a sensitivity analysis when the climate could impact the valuation of forest assets and biological assets. For example, future timber volume and possible harvesting are impacted by climate change through increased growth, and in parallel greater risk of infestation and extreme weather conditions.
²⁾ The sensitivity figures are based on the Swedish market price, which for 2023 has been set to SEK 395 (366) /m³fo.
³⁾ Since valuation in the discounted cash flow model treats the distribution of the market value of the total asset, this sensitivity would not impact the total value of the forest assets but rather transfer the value between biological assets and land assets.

# D4 Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities

## § ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

**Lessee**

SCA's lease agreements primarily consist of trains, office premises, terminals, warehouses, other buildings, land leases, various transport vehicles, and company cars. SCA uses the available exemption for short-term leases (leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases where the underlying asset has a low value. Leases covered by the exemption largely consist of photocopiers and coffee machines.

On the date of initial application for the lease, the lease liability is measured at the present value of outstanding lease payments. Lease payments are to be discounted by the interest rate implicit in the lease contract, if it can be readily determined. In cases where the rate cannot be readily determined, lease payments are discounted using SCA's incremental borrowing rate. A substantial part of SCA's lease liability has been discounted using the incremental borrowing rate. SCA has prepared a method for determining the incremental borrowing rate, which includes the credit rating of the individual subsidiaries, the economic environment, contract duration of the lease, and class of asset. Updating the incremental borrowing rate is performed on a regular basis of new and modified contracts. Lease liabilities are classified as financial liabilities, see Note E4.

The lease term is defined as the non-cancellable lease period together with periods that may be covered by an option to extend a lease if the lessee is reasonably certain of utilizing this alternative and periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain of not utilizing this alternative. SCA has a number of contracts where the contractual terms clearly encompass extension periods. The right to an extension has been included in the lease term when SCA with reasonable assurance can determine that the contract will be extended.

Impairment is addressed in Note D2.

**Assessed useful lives of right-of-use assets**

| | Number of years |
|---|---|
| Company cars | 3–4 |
| Other | 2–8 |
| Trains | 10 |
| Work vehicles | 3–12 |
| Properties, real estate | 3–40 |

**Lessor**

Agreements where SCA is a lessor are primarily consisting of development rights for land connected to wind power projects, leasing non-productive forest land and leasing parts of industrial facilities and other subletting of property. All contracts when SCA is lessor are classified as operating leases. The classification is primarily based on the master agreement entered into by SCA and not on the basis of the underlying asset.

## ! KEY ASSESSMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS

IFRS 16 Leases stipulates that when entering into any agreement an assessment must be made of whether the contract is or includes a lease. SCA assesses all contracts entering into force on an individual basis with the exception of contracts for company cars, which are assessed as a portfolio. In cases where a lease contract includes an identifiable asset, but where SCA is not entitled to receive essentially all benefits from use of the asset or is not entitled to control use of the identified asset, SCA's opinion in all instances is that the contract is not, nor does it contain, a lease agreement. A contract can include components that are not to be classified as lease components, such as included services, personnel, and administration. SCA has chosen to exclude non-lease components for all leases.

SCA has not included the right to an extension in the lease term where the lease period exceeds ten years as the assessment is that "reasonable assurance" cannot be applied to such a long interval. The following extension periods have been utilized for contracts that include a right to an extension for an unspecified period and where SCA with reasonable assurance will utilize this right: forklifts and other work vehicles 3 years, property 3–5 years.

A number of contracts include an option to withdraw from the agreement early, but an early termination would then trigger a termination fee, the size of which is dependent on when the agreement is terminated. In no instance over the lease term has SCA considered the option to withdraw from an agreement early as there are often significant termination fee. In cases where SCA and its counterparty are each independently entitled to terminate a lease without the consent of the counterparty and without a substantial financial penalty, SCA has considered the agreement as unenforceable. In cases where only the counterparty was entitled to terminate an agreement, the contract's period of notice has constituted the lease term. When SCA has been solely entitled to terminate an agreement, the lease term in the majority of cases was assessed as 3–5 years, as described above.

In applicable cases, residual value guarantees were taken into account when determining the lease payments.

### § ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and bank balances as well as short-term investments with a maturity of less than three months from the acquisition date. Loan receivables are recognized at amortized cost. Equity instruments comprise shares measured at fair value. These shares are not held for trading, which is why changes in value in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments are recognized in equity through other comprehensive income. The changes in value related to exchange gains/losses are recognized in net financial items.

# E3 Trade receivables

§ ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

Trade receivables belong to the category of financial assets measured at amortized cost, since the purpose of the holding is to obtain contractual cash flows. In compliance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, SCA applies a simplified impairment model for trade receivables, whereby the expected credit loss is recognized for the estimated remaining lifetime of the receivable. In the past, SCA has not incurred significant customer losses and these losses have not exhibited significantly different loss patterns for various customers segments or economic cycles, which is why a matrix is used to measure expected customer losses. The provision for expected customer losses is based on an individual assessment of overdue trade receivables for each customer. The basis for the assessment of credit risk in the part of the customer portfolio that is not assessed individually is the average loss frequency of historical customer losses. The average loss frequency is adjusted as necessary to take into account changes in credit risk. The total provision for expected customer losses, in addition to the trade receivables assessed individually, amounted to SEK –9m (–10) at the end of 2023. SCA has signed credit insurance in order to reduce its credit risk. The trade receivables covered by the credit insurance amount to 36% (43) of total trade receivables on December 31, 2023. Any impairment of trade receivables affects SCA's other operating expenses. SCA's trade receivables are current and are not discounted.

## Trade receivables

| SEKm | 2023 | 2022 |
|---|---|---|
| Trade receivables, gross | 2,892 | 3,046 |
| Provision to reserves for expected customer losses | –34 | –39 |

## Borrowing

Climate and sustainability have become an integrated and increasingly essential part of credit analyses from creditors, banks and rating institutions. It is therefore crucial to fulfil the ever more stringent standards in this area. SCA's commitment to sustainability and the climate value integrated in SCA's balance sheet and value chain have enabled good opportunities for SCA to secure financing, and are expected to continue doing so, even if requirements are tightened. This presents opportunities for diversification between different lending sources, longer maturities and favorable terms, which reduces refinancing risk.

## Bond loans and bilateral loans

SCA has a Medium Term Note (MTN) program with an amount of SEK 8,000m (8,000) for issuing bonds in the capital market. As of December 31, 2023, a nominal SEK 4,000m (4,000) was outstanding, of which green bonds accounted for SEK 1,500m (1,500). In addition to the bond loans, SCA has several long bilateral loans with strong and well-established banks at a nominal amount of SEK 8,336m (7,921). Of this amount, SEK 4,192m is loans drawn from SCA's bilateral credit facility.

## Green bonds

SCA's green bonds were issued under the SCA Green Bond Framework, which complies with the Green Bond Principles. The framework was reviewed by the independent party Cicero Shades of Green and received the highest possible ranking (Dark Green). The framework regulates that borrowing under the framework is earmarked for green investments. The criteria for when an investment can be classified as green are specified by the framework. SCA reports back to bond holders about the green investments every year.

## Issued bond loans

| SEKm | Maturity, year | Carrying amount | Fair value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bond – floating rate | 2025 | 1,000 | 1,003 |
| Bond – fixed rate | 2025 | 300 | 287 |
| Bond – fixed rate | 2027 | 1,200 | 1,113 |

## Balance sheet
SCA uses financial derivatives to manage risks in currency, interest rate and energy price. For a description of how SCA manages these risks, refer to the Board of Directors' Report. The table above shows the derivatives that impacted the Group's balance sheet on December 31, 2023. For more information relating to derivatives in the balance sheet, refer to Note E1.

## Income statement
Hedges pertaining to transaction exposure had an impact of SEK –360m (–661) on operating profit for the period. The net market value amounted to SEK 269m (–94) on the balance sheet date. Currency hedges decreased the cost of non-current assets by SEK –15m (–6). The net market value amounted to SEK –40m (5) on the balance sheet date. The net market value for interest rate risk hedges amounted to SEK 27m (2). Interest rate derivatives impacted net interest items in an amount of SEK 31m (–80).

Energy derivatives had an impact of SEK 60m (137) on operating profit for the period. Energy derivatives had an outstanding market value of SEK 43m (265) on the balance sheet date. For further information relating to net financial items, refer to Note E7.

# E6 Derivatives and hedge accounting

## § ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

### Accounting for derivatives used for hedging purposes
All derivatives are initially and continuously recognized at fair value in the balance sheet. Fair value for currency options is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Gains and losses on remeasurement of derivatives used for hedging purposes are recognized as described below.

### Cash flow hedges
Gains and losses on remeasurement of derivatives intended for cash flow hedging are recognized in equity under other comprehensive income and reversed to the income statement at the rate, at which the hedged cash flow affects the income statement. For hedges of non-financial assets and liabilities, the result of the hedge is recognized at historical cost without a reclassification adjustment and therefore does not affect other comprehensive income. Cash flow hedges relating to energy affect the energy costs, that is, cost of goods sold. Transaction exposure's cash flow hedges affect consolidated net sales and expenses. Cash flow hedges relating to interest expenses affect net financial items.

When option contracts are used to hedge currency flows, the Group designates only the intrinsic value of the options as the hedging instrument. Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the options are recognized within other comprehensive income in the hedge reserve within equity. The changes in the time value of the options that relate to the hedged item are recognized within other comprehensive income in the costs of hedging reserve within equity.

### Financial hedges
When SCA conducts financial hedges and the transactions do not meet requirements for hedge accounting according to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, changes in fair value of the hedging instrument are recognized directly in the income statement against the initial hedged item.

# Sensitivity analysis
SCA has performed sensitivity analysis calculations on the financial instruments' risk at December 31, 2023 using assumptions on market movements that are regarded as reasonably possible in one year's time. If the Swedish krona is unilaterally weakened/strengthened by 5% against all currencies, outstanding financial hedges, trade payables and trade receivables would decrease/increase profit before tax by SEK 264m (391). Financial hedges with maturities of more than one year would increase/decrease equity by SEK 9m (11).

For forward cover relating to the cost of non-current assets, a 5% increase/decrease in the strength of the Swedish krona would entail a decrease/increase in equity of SEK 9m (9). For hedge options relating to the cost of non-current assets, a 5% increase in the strength of the Swedish krona would entail a decrease in equity of SEK 28m (6) and, conversely, a weakening of the Swedish krona of 5% would increase equity by SEK 30m (7).

If energy prices increase/decrease by 20%, outstanding financial hedges relating to electricity would decrease/increase energy costs for the period by SEK 27m (46). In addition to the earnings impact, equity would increase/decrease by SEK 14m (40).

¹⁾ Outstanding derivatives with hedge accounting are included in the table Outstanding derivatives on the previous page.

The results from fair value hedges are recognized directly in the income statement.

## Hedge reserve in equity
Currency derivatives relating to hedging of transaction exposure mature mainly in 2024 and during the first quarter of 2025. With unchanged exchange rates, profit after tax will be affected in an amount of SEK 214m (–74). Currency derivatives relating to hedging of the cost of non-current assets have a maturity spread until the end of 2025. With unchanged exchange rates, the cost of non-current assets will change by SEK –32m (–4) after tax.

The derivatives intended to hedge energy costs in the Group mature during 2024–2025. With unchanged prices, the Group's profit after tax will be affected in an amount of SEK 34m (183) after tax.

# E7 Financial income and expenses

¹⁾ Other financial income and expenses include an exchange difference of SEK 5m (1).  
²⁾ Capitalized interest has reduced interest expenses by SEK 45m (162).

## Sensitivity analysis
If interest rate levels had been 2 percentage points higher, with unchanged fixed-interest terms and net debt, interest expenses for the period would have been SEK 144m (142) higher. A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the risk to which SCA was exposed at December 31, 2023 using assumptions on market movements that are regarded as reasonable in one year's time. A description of how SCA manages its interest rate risk can be found on page 71.

# F Group structure

## F1 Subsidiaries

### ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
**Subsidiaries**
Gällö Timber AB is 50% owned by SCA and 50% owned by AB Persson Invest. SCA is considered to have a controlling influence over Gällö Timber AB, despite the fact that SCA does not have a majority of the votes in the company. SCA is deemed to have a controlling influence since it has control over activities with an impact on Gällö Timber AB's return. The SCA Group thus consolidates 100% of the company. Gällö Timber AB manages forest and sells solid-wood products. Sales amounted to SEK 899m (1,382). The company has paid a dividend totaling SEK 100m (200), of which SEK 50m (100) to SCA. SCA is entitled under option contracts to purchase the remaining shares in the company, whereby SCA has recognized an option liability in the balance sheet and does not recognize any non-controlling interest in equity.

# F3 Corporate acquisitions and divestments

§ ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

**Acquisition of subsidiaries**  
SCA applies IFRS 3 Business Combinations in connection with acquisitions. A corporate acquisition can be classified as a business combination or an asset acquisition. If the acquired assets are not part of a business, the transaction is recognized as an asset acquisition.

A corporate acquisition with the primary purpose of acquiring the company's properties and where any of the company's management organization and administration are of secondary importance for the acquisition, is classified as an asset acquisition. For an asset acquisition, no deferred tax is recognized attributable to the acquisition.

**Acquisitions**  
In 2023, Fasikan Vind AB was acquired, a wind power project located on SCA's land in Bräcke municipality for approximately SEK 280m on a debt-free basis.

In 2022, approximately 8,000 hectares of forest land was acquired in the Baltic region through four transactions for a purchase consideration of about SEK 550m on a debt-free basis.

In 2022, Skogberget Vind AB, was acquired for approximately SEK 800m. Skogberget Vind AB primarily has assets associated with wind farm operations in Markbygden, Piteå municipality.

All of the acquisitions were recognized as asset acquisitions.

In 2023, SCA decided to exercise its purchase option to acquire the remaining shares in Gällö Timber AB, thereby acquiring a 100% ownership stake in the company. The acquisition is expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2024.

**Divestments**  
No companies were divested in 2023. In 2022, 50% of the shares in Biorefinery Östrand AB were divested.

# G Other

## G1 Contingent liabilities, pledged assets and commitments

**Contingent liabilities**

| SEKm | 2023 | 2022 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Guarantees for: | | |
| associated companies | 5 | 5 |
| customers and others | 28 | 28 |
| Other contingent liabilities | 24 | 19 |
| Total | 57 | 52 |

**Pledged assets**  
As of December 31, 2023, SCA had no liabilities for which assets were pledged as collateral. As of December 31, 2022, liabilities for which assets were pledged as collateral amounted to SEK 11m. SCA holds no chattel mortgages.

**Commitments**  
SCA has a decided investment in Obbola totaling SEK 7,500m over a five-year period. As of December 31, 2023, SEK 139m remained as contracted commitments. The commitment in its entirety refers to non-current assets.

SCA has a decided investment in wind power projects totaling SEK 1,715m over a two-year period. As of December 31, 2023, SEK 1,427m remained as contracted commitments. The commitments pertain entirely to non-current assets.

SCA has, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, pledged to repay liabilities that a joint venture has undertaken. As of December 31, 2023, SCA Group's obligation amounted to SEK 71m (27).

**Pledged guarantees**  
As of December 31, 2023, SCA's pledged guarantees pertaining to forestry machines to subcontractors amounted to SEK 335m (329). In SCA's opinion, the pledged guarantees pose an insignificant risk and the value has therefore not been recognized as a contingent liability.

## G2 Transactions with related parties

To the extent that transactions with related parties took place, these were based on generally accepted commercial terms and conditions including pricing in the industry, and were entered into on standard commercial conditions. In 2023, SCA sold tall oil to Scastone AB for approximately SEK 512m and services to Östrand Biorefinery AB for approximately SEK 37m.

For information regarding salaries and other remuneration, costs and obligations for pensions and similar benefits for the Board of Directors, President and CEO and other senior executives, refer to Notes C3–C5.

Otherwise, no transactions took place between SCA and related parties.
