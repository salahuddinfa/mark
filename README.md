These figures include ¥0.4 billion in amortization of intangible assets, ¥0.1 billion in impairment losses, ¥2.2 billion in restructuring costs, and ¥0.1 billion in reorganization expenses, which are excluded from the company’s core performance metrics.  ### **Overview of Consolidated Profit/Loss (Core Basis)**  Revenue for the first quarter increased to ¥288.5 billion (+21.8% YoY), driven by higher product sales despite a decline in other revenue.  - **Product sales** reached ¥259.7 billion (+27.0% YoY). Domestic sales remained flat due to drug price revisions and generic competition, offset by strong performance of new products (Fesgo, Piasclay) and key brands (Babesmo). Overseas sales surged, driven by increased exports of Hemlibra and Actemra to Roche.  - **Other revenue** declined to ¥28.7 billion (-11.7% YoY) due to reduced one-time payments, despite higher Hemlibra-related income.  - **Gross profit** improved to ¥201.0 billion (+22.3% YoY), with the cost of sales ratio improving by 1.8 percentage points to 33.7% due to favorable product mix.  –2–START OF LOGICAL PAGE 5 

**Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (4519) First Quarter Financial Results for the Fiscal Year Ending December 2025**R&D expenses were ¥40.7 billion (a decrease of 1.2% year-on-year), while selling, general, and administrative expenses were ¥21.0 billion (a decrease of 0.9% year-on-year), both remaining at levels comparable to the same period last year. Other operating income (expenses) resulted in income of ¥0.3 billion (compared to income of ¥0.2 billion in the same period last year). As a result, Core operating profit was ¥139.5 billion (an increase of 36.6% year-on-year), and Core quarterly profit was ¥99.2 billion (an increase of 30.5% year-on-year).## ※About Core Results  With the transition to IFRS, the company has been disclosing Core results since 2013. Core results are derived by adjusting IFRS results for items the company considers non-recurring. Note that the items considered non-recurring may differ from Roche’s judgment due to differences in business scale or scope. The company uses Core results as an indicator for internal performance management, explaining trends in recurring profitability to stakeholders, and determining performance-based allocations, including shareholder returns.  For details, please refer to page 1 of the supplementary materials for the consolidated financial results for the first quarter of the fiscal year ending December 2025 (IFRS) dated April 24, 2025 (hereinafter referred to as the "Supplementary Materials"), titled "Reconciliation from IFRS Results to Core Results."  ## <Breakdown of Product Sales>  (Unit: ¥ billion)  |                                | Q1 FY2025 Results | Q1 FY2024 Results | YoY Change ||--------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------|| **Product Sales**              | 2,597           | 2,045            | +27.0%     || **Domestic Product Sales**     | 1,030           | 1,032            | △0.2%      || - Oncology Segment            | 531             | 561              | △5.3%      || - Specialty Segment           | 499             | 470              | +6.2%      || **Overseas Product Sales**    | 1,567           | 1,013            | +54.7%     |## [Domestic Product Sales]  Domestic product sales amounted to ¥103.0 billion (a decrease of 0.2% year-on-year), as growth from new and key products was offset by the impact of drug price revisions and generic competition.  Sales in the **oncology segment** were ¥53.1 billion (a decrease of 5.3% year-on-year). While sales of the new product, the anti-cancer/HER2 humanized monoclonal antibody-hyaluronidase combination "Phesgo," performed well, sales of key products such as the anti-cancer/VEGF humanized monoclonal antibody "Avastin" declined due to drug price revisions and generic competition. Additionally, sales of the anti-cancer/HER2 humanized monoclonal antibody "Perjeta" fell significantly below the previous year's level, primarily due to the market penetration of "Phesgo," a subcutaneous injection formulation containing the drug.  Sales in the **specialty segment** were ¥49.9 billion (an increase of 6.2% year-on-year). Despite the impact of drug price revisions and generic competition, sales increased due to strong performance of the key product, the ophthalmic VEGF/Ang-2 inhibitor "Vabysmo," robust market penetration of the new product, the pH-dependent binding humanized anti-complement (C5) monoclonal antibody "PiaSky," and higher sales of the anti-influenza drug "Tamiflu."  ## [Overseas Product Sales]  Overseas product sales amounted to ¥156.7 billion (an increase of 54.7% year-on-year). Exports to Roche saw significant growth, driven by strong performance of the anti-coagulation Factor IIa/Xa humanized bispecific monoclonal antibody "Hemlibra" and the humanized anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody "Actemra."  -3-START OF LOGICAL PAGE 6

Within this, Net Working Capital declined by ¥41.7 billion to ¥407.0 billion, primarily due to reduced accounts receivable from royalty settlements and decreased inventory. Long-Term Net Operating Assets increased by ¥22.8 billion to ¥521.7 billion, driven mainly by investments in the biopharmaceutical production facility (UT3) and injectable drug facility (UTA) at the Utsunomiya Plant.  As detailed in the "Cash Flow Status" section, Net Cash (including securities and interest-bearing debt) decreased by ¥51.7 billion to ¥944.6 billion. Other Non-Operating Net Assets rose by ¥76.4 billion to ¥33.9 billion, largely due to reduced unpaid corporate income taxes.  Consequently, Total Net Assets increased by ¥5.7 billion to ¥1,907.2 billion compared to the end of the previous fiscal year.  ##### ※Notes on Net Operating Assets (NOA) and Net Assets  The Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is prepared in accordance with IAS 1 "Presentation of Financial Statements." Net Operating Assets (NOA) and Net Assets are internally reconfigured metrics for management purposes, similar to disclosures by Roche. Note that NOA and Net Assets do not exclude items as in "Core" performance metrics.  For details, refer to Supplementary Materials P. 8 "Financial Position."  ##### ※Notes on Net Operating Assets (NOA)  NOA (Net Operating Assets) enables evaluation of the Group’s performance independently of financial or tax-related transactions. It is calculated by deducting provisions from Net Working Capital and Long-Term Net Operating Assets (including tangible fixed assets, right-of-use assets, and intangible assets).  -5–START OF LOGICAL PAGE 8

Despite ¥22.0 billion in expenditures for tangible fixed assets, operating free cash flow increased to ¥162.4 billion (+17.8% YoY), driven by a ¥40.8 billion reduction in net working capital (see "Asset, Liability, and Equity Status" for details).  After paying ¥106.9 billion in corporate income tax, free cash flow was ¥42.7 billion (△51.0% YoY).  Net cash decreased by ¥51.7 billion after adjusting for dividend payments of ¥93.4 billion.  Cash and equivalents (excluding securities and interest-bearing debt) decreased by ¥116.8 billion, ending the quarter at ¥423.4 billion.  **※Free Cash Flow (FCF) Note:**  The consolidated cash flow statement follows IFRS 7.

**Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (4519) Q1 FY December 2025 Earnings Summary**#### (5) Notes Regarding Going Concern Assumption  There are no applicable matters.  #### (6) Notes to Summary Quarterly Consolidated Financial Statements  #### 1 Significant Accounting Policies and Other Matters  ##### (a) Basis of Preparation  These summary quarterly consolidated financial statements pertain to Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries, headquartered in Japan (Tokyo) and listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (Securities Code: 4519). These summary quarterly consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on April 24, 2025.  Roche Holding Ltd. is the parent company of the Roche Group, listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange and reporting its financial performance in accordance with IFRS. Through a strategic alliance with Roche, our Group has been a key member of the Roche Group since October 2002. Roche Holding Ltd. owns 59.89% of Chugai’s total issued shares (61.11% on a treasury stock-excluded basis).  Our Group prepares these summary quarterly consolidated financial statements in accordance with Article 5, Paragraph 2 of the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s Standards for Quarterly Financial Statements (with partial omission of disclosures under IAS 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" as permitted by Article 5, Paragraph 5 of the same standards).  Since these summary quarterly consolidated financial statements do not include all the information required for annual consolidated financial statements, they should be used in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the previous fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.  The summary quarterly consolidated financial statements are presented in Japanese yen, our functional currency, with amounts below one million yen rounded. Measurements are based on historical cost, except for certain items required to be measured at fair value.  #### (b) Significant Accounting Judgments, Estimates, and Assumptions  The preparation of summary quarterly consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. These estimates may differ from actual results. Estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and various factors and are reviewed continuously. The effects of changes in estimates are recognized in the period in which the changes are made.  Information regarding judgments, estimates, and assumptions that significantly affect the amounts recognized in our Group’s summary quarterly consolidated financial statements is generally consistent with those of the previous fiscal year.  #### (c) Changes in Accounting Policies  The significant accounting policies applied in our Group’s summary quarterly consolidated financial statements are consistent with those applied in the consolidated financial statements for the previous fiscal year.  Minor changes were made to certain accounting standards, but they do not have a material impact on our Group’s financial performance or position.  13  ―START OF LOGICAL PAGE 16
