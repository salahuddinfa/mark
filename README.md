# Notes to the Financial Statements


## 1. General Information


### a) Reporting entity

Bloomsbury Publishing Plc (the "Company") is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales and domiciled in the United
Kingdom. The address of the Company's registered office can be found on page 212. The consolidated financial statements of the
Company as at and for the year ended 28 February 2025 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
The Group is primarily involved in the publication of books and other related services.


### b) Statement of compliance

The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with UK-adopted international
accounting standards ("IFRS") and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.


### c) Basis of preparation

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis (see Note 1d) and under the historical cost convention
as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and liabilities at fair value.

This year, we have adopted a rounding practice to present current and prior year figures in millions instead of thousands. This change aims
to enhance the clarity and usability of our financial statements.

These consolidated financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 21 May 2025.


### d) Going concern

The Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out
in the Strategic Report on pages 10 to 90. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position are described in the
Financial Review on pages 30 to 34. In addition, Note 24 to the financial statements includes the Group's objectives, policies and processes
for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments, and its exposures to credit risk and
liquidity risk.

The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence at least 12 months
from the date of approval of the financial statements, being the period of the detailed going concern assessment reviewed by the Board,
and, therefore, continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

The Board has modelled a severe but plausible downside scenario. This assumes that:

� print revenues are reduced by 20% during 2025/2026 with recovery during 2026/2027;

� digital revenues are reduced by 20% during 2025/2026 with recovery during 2026/2027;

� print costs are increased by 2% from 2025/2026 and staff costs are increased by 2% from 2026/2027;

� downside assumptions about extended debtor days during 2025/2026, with recovery during 2026/2027; and

. cash preservation measures are implemented, and variable costs are reduced.

At 28 February 2025, the Group had available liquidity of �60.6m, comprising central cash balances and its undrawn �20m Revolving Credit
Facility ("RCF"). The RCF agreement is to November 2027. Under the severe but plausible downside scenario, the Group would maintain
sufficient liquidity headroom even before modelling the mitigating effect of actions that management would take in the event that these
downside risks were to crystallise. Details of the bank facility and its covenants are shown in Note 24c).


### e) Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual
results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in
which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. Critical judgements and areas where the use of estimates is significant are
disclosed in Note 2s).
