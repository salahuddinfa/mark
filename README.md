# Notes


## Note 1 Basis of preparation


### General:

Intrum AB as a standalone entity ("the Company" or "the Parent") is regis-
tered and domiciled in Stockholm, Sweden. The Company is listed as a large
company on Nasdaq Stockholm, a stock exchange located in Sweden.

The Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, "the Group") main opera-
tion is to provide payment solutions, credit and collection services to clients
and investments in non-performing loans. Post-2023 disposals, the Group
operates in the European market.

The financial statements are presented in Swedish Krona ("SEK") and
rounded to the nearest million ("SEK M").


### Accounting Framework:

The Groups' consolidated financial statements are prepared in compliance
with:

· the Swedish Annual Accounts Act - Årsredovisningslag (1995:1554);

· the EU-adopted IFRSs, including interpretations issued by the IFRS Inter-
pretation Committee ("IFRIC"); and

· RFR 1 Supplementary Accounting Rules for Groups issued by the Swedish
Financial Reporting Board ("SFRB").

The Company's standalone financial statements are prepared using the same
accounting framework as the Group's consolidated financial statements. In
addition, the Company's financial statements comply with RFR 2 Account-
ing for Legal Entities issued by the SFRB. RFR 2 requires that the standalone
financial statements should be prepared in accordance with the EU-adopted
IFRSs within the framework of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act, taking into
account the connection between reporting and taxation. The recommenda-
tion specifies exemptions and additions relative to IFRSs' requirements.

The financial statements are composed of the primary statements: State-
ment of Income ("SOI"), Statement of Comprehensive Income ("SOCI"),
Statement of Financial Position ("SFP"), Statement of Cash Flows ("SCF"),
Statement of Changes in Equity ("SCE") and accompanying notes ("the
Notes") to the primary statements.

The SOI is prepared based on the 'function of expenses' method: "Direct
Costs" and "Indirect Costs". The Notes provide details based on the 'nature
of expenses' method. The SCF is prepared based on the 'indirect' method.


### Going-concern Assumption:

The financial statements are prepared based on a going-concern assump-
tion. The Group's management has assessed the potential future cash gener-
ation of the Group, its liquidity, existing funding availability and other actions
which may be taken to further improve cash management and has concluded
that there are no financial or other indicators that may cast significant doubt
upon the Group's ability to operate and meet its obligations in the next 12
months from the approval date (see note 35).


### Materiality:

The Group and the Parent financial statements are prepared based on fol-
lowing materiality thresholds:

· Transactions(s) affecting financial performance, specifically in SOI and
SCF are assessed as material if such transaction(s) exceed 2% of 'Income'
reported in the current reporting period;

· Transaction(s) affecting financial position, specifically reported in SFP and
SCE are assessed as material if such transaction(s) exceed 1% of 'Total
Assets' reported in the current reporting period; and

. In addition to the above quantitative threshold, transaction(s) or event(s)
are also considered material if omission of these transaction(s) or event(s)
could negatively affect users of the financial statements. Specifically, if
these transaction(s) or event(s) affect our key non-GAAP leverage and
cash performance metrics. In case, if a transaction or event is assessed as
material based on the qualitative assessment alone, then as a minimum, a
disclosure note is included in the financial statement to explain such trans-
action(s) or/and event(s), respectively.


## Note 2 Accounting policies


### Standards, Interpretations, Rules and Other Changes Adopted During 2023:

Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement (February 2021)
The IASB issued an amendment which requires only material accounting pol-
icies should be disclosed in financial statements. Previously, IAS 1 required all
significant accounting policies to be disclosed in the financial statements. The
amendment also provides guidance to assist in applying materiality judge-
ment. On application of this amendment, accounting policies will only be dis-
closed if the underlying transactions are assessed as material and vice versa.

The amendment became effective from 1 January 2023. In accordance
with this guidance, the Group only includes accounting policies that are
material (see Note 1) to the financial statements.


#### Amendments to IAS 8 (February 2021)

The IASB issued an amendment to explain the term 'accounting estimate'
and also guidance to differentiate it with an 'accounting error'. Change to
accounting estimates are applied prospectively.

The amendment became effective from 1 January 2023. The Group's
existing application is in line with this guidance. Therefore, this amendment
has no material impact to the financial statements.


#### Amendments to IAS 12 (May 2021)

The IASB issued an amendment in reference to IFRS 16 Leases, which clar-
ifies that a taxable temporary difference should not be recognised, at the
time of the transaction, if it does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible
temporary differences. The amendment is expected to reduce diversity in
practice and provide better information for users. In case, the lease transac-
tion gives rise to equal taxable and temporary differences then a deferred tax
asset and liability is recognised on initial recognition.

The amendment became effective from 1 January 2023. Lease liability
(see Note 22) and related taxes (see Note 7) are not material to the Group's
financial statements.


#### Amendments to IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 (December 2021)

The IASB issued an amendment to provide guidance to entities applying IFRS
17 and IFRS 9 for the first time. The amendment provides guidance relating
to comparative information which needs to be restated as part of first-time
application of IFRS 17.

The amendment became effective from 1 January 2023. The Group
doesn't write any insurance business and will not be impacted by IFRS 17. The
financial guarantees issued by the Group are recognised under IFRS 9.

#### Amendments to IAS 12 (May 2023)

In May 2023, the IASB issued 'International Tax Reform-Pillar Two Model
Rules', which amended IAS 12, to provide accounting guidance around the
domestic minimum top-up taxes coming into effect in 2024.

The amendments introduced a temporary exception to the requirements
to recognise and disclose information about deferred tax assets and liabili-
ties related to Pillar Two income taxes, and require an entity to disclose that
it has applied the exception. The temporary exception applies until the IASB
either removes it or makes it permanent. The Group has applied this excep-
tion to the 2023 financial statements.

The Group is assessing the impact of Pillar Two requirements. The known
or reasonable estimable information to help users of financial statements
understand the entity's exposure to Pillar Two income taxes are disclosed in
Note 8.


### Changes to the Primary Statements

During 2023, the Group completed the technical review and has made fol-
lowing changes to comply with the technical standards and improve presen-
tation of its primary statements:

· Previously, this primary statements were referred as 'Income Statement',
'Statement of Comprehensive Income', 'Balance Sheet', 'Cash Flow State-
ment' and 'Statement of Changes in Shareholders" Equity'. These are now
referred as 'Statement of Income' ("SOI"), 'Statement of Comprehensive
Income' ("SOCI), 'Statement of Cash Flows' ("SCF") and 'Statement of
Changes in Equity' ("SCE"), respectively.

· Previously, 'Revenue' in SOI and the Notes was used for all items arising
from IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 requirement. Technically, 'Revenue' is mainly used
for IFRS 15 items. For technical clarity, 'Income' instead of 'Revenue' termi-
nology will be used now in the financial statements.

· Previously, 'Revenue' included servicing income, interest income, and
other gains and losses. 'Income' going forward include servicing income,
interest income (excluding income forming part of operational cash man-
agement), sale of property holdings, portfolios and lease income.

· Previously, 'Expenses' and 'Costs' were presented based on 'functional'
analysis: 'Costs of Sales', 'Sales, Marketing and Administrative Expenses'.
'Expenses' and 'Costs' going forward will continue to be presented
on 'functional' analysis, but will be simply split into 2 buckets: 'Direct
Costs' and 'Indirect Costs' (see Note 5). Direct Costs represent all costs
/ expenses that are directly associated with Income generating activity.
There are no subjective allocations applied. If an item is mostly and incre-
mentally associated with Income then whole item is included in Direct
Costs. All other regular or recurring costs / expenses are included in Indi-
rect Costs. Exceptional items, if applicable, like group restructuring costs
are included in 'Other Operating Items'. The Notes to SOI provides break-
down based on 'nature' analysis. The following table illustrates the group-
ing differences in SOI between the old and the new presentation format:

</table>

*1 Net Credit Gains / Losses

*2 Group changes between Direct and Indirect Costs

** Old format used in 2022


· Previously, 'Revaluation of Gains / Losses' was used to remeasurement
of portfolio investments. This mainly represented the differences aris-
ing from revision of cashflow estimates based on credit-adjusted Effec-
tive Interest Rate ("EIR"). Based on the technical review, this has now been
changed to 'Credit Gains / Losses'. In addition to the revision of gross
cashflows, this will also incorporate changes in costs to collect, which
could result in lowering of net collections. This change has no material
impact on the comparative and prior years' financial statements.

· Previously, hedging activities were not prominently disclosed. These are
now prominently disclosed in SOCI, SCF and SCE.

· Previously, 'Goodwill', 'Capitalised Expenditure for IT Development and
Other Intangibles' and 'Client Relationships' were separately disclosed on
SFP. These items are now aggregated and disclosed as 'Intangible Assets'.

· Previously, 'Liabilities to Credit Institutions' and 'Bond Loans' were sepa-
rately disclosed on SFP. These items are now aggregated and disclosed as
'Borrowings'.

· Previously, 'Derivatives' were disclosed within Notes to the financial state-
ments. 'Derivatives' are now prominently disclosed on SFP.

· Previously, 'Accounts Receivable', 'Other Receivables' and 'Prepaid
Expenses and Accrued Income' were separately disclosed on SFP. These
items are now aggregated and disclosed as 'Receivable and Other Oper-
ating Assets' and breakdown is included in the Notes to the financial
statements.

· Previously, 'Accounts Payable', 'Advances from Clients' and 'Accrued
Expenses and Prepaid Income' were separately disclosed on SFP.
These are now aggregated and disclosed as 'Payable and Other Oper-
ating Assets' and breakdown is included in the Notes to the financial
statements.

· Previously, 'Amortisation of Portfolio Investments' was included in operat-
ing cashflows. Technically, this forms part of investing activities. Accord-
ingly, all movements in Portfolio Investments balance are included in
investing cashflows except for interest income.

· Previously, 'Property Holdings' was included in investing cashflows. As
this is part of the operating cycle, it is now included as part of working cap-
ital changes in operating cashflows in SCF.


### Changes to the Notes

· Previously, 'Portfolio Investments', 'Credit Market Services' and 'Strate-
gic Markets' were recognised as segments. Based on the new strategy and
technical review, the Group now have two business segments: 'Servic-
ing' and 'Portfolio Investments'. These operating segments are further split
into following geographical segments: 'Northern Markets', 'Middle Mar-
kets', 'Southern Markets' and 'Tactical Markets'.

· Previously, 'Credit Management Services' and 'Strategic Markets' were
recognised as Cash-Generating Units ("CGUs"). Based on the change in
strategy and technical review, the Group now recognises CGUs at Mar-
kets level:

· Northern Markets (4 markets): 'Norway', 'Sweden', 'Denmark' and
‘Finland'

· Middle Markets (5 markets): 'Austria & Germany', 'Belgium & Nether-
lands', 'Switzerland', 'France' and 'UK & Ireland'

· Southern Markets (4 markets): 'Portugal', 'Spain', 'Italy' and 'Greece'

· Tactical Markets (4 markets): 'Czech Republic', 'Slovakia', 'Hungary' and
'Poland'

· Previously, Weighted Average Cost of Capital ("WACC") was applied at
the aggregated CGUs level of 'Credit Markets Services' and 'Strategic
Markets'. As the CGUs got changed, the WACC accordingly is estimated
at Markets level.

· Previously, the forecasting period for goodwill impairment test was 8
years. Based on the technical review, the Group has decided to reduce the
forecasting period to 5 years.


### Accounting Errors:


#### Goodwill Disclosure

The Group's 2022 SFP reported the Goodwill balance of SEK 35,143 million,
whilst the Note reported the balance of SEK 38,777 million.

The balance and additional quantitative analysis (including the sensitivity
analysis) reported in the Note was incorrect. This being a material disclosure
error has been restated in 2023 annual report (See Note 8). This error had
no impact on the primary financial statements. The Goodwill note in 2022
annual report resulted in showing a small headroom to impairment, whilst in
actual the headroom was higher.

##### Joint Ventures

The Group's 2022 joint ventures note omitted to disclose Ithaca Investment
DAC relationship with Penelope Spv Srl. In addition, the summarised finan-
cial statements omitted to eliminate intercompany transactions. This being a
material disclosure has been restated in 2023 annual report (See Note 9). In
addition, the note has been updated with additional quantitative and qual-
itative information to provide clarity around influence (voting rights), eco-
nomic entitlement (rights to cashflows) and ownership (legal structure). The
updates also provide more transparency to understand the linkage between
accounting and cash income - a key adjustment made to our leverage ratio.


### Segment Disclosure

The Group's 2022 segment note omitted to disclose tangible and intangible
assets for certain countries that were above the materiality threshold. This
segment disclosure has been restated in 2023 annual report (see Note 26).


### Standards, Interpretations, Rules and Other Changes Effective in 2024 Onwards:

Amendment to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement: (January 2020, July 2020
& October 2022)

In October 2022, the IASB provided clarification between 'current' and
'non-current' classification of liabilities. The guidance clarifies that a liability
should be classified as 'non-current' if an entity can defer the settlement of
liability for 12 months from the reporting date. It states that covenants com-
pliance and any renegotiations before the reporting date that allows defer-
ring settlement for 12 months should result in 'non-current' classification.

The update also requires additional disclosures in subsequent events note
if liability is classified as 'current' and 'non-current' as at the reporting date,
but a material settlement or expectation of settlement timing significantly
changes after the reporting date but before the financial statements are
authorised for issue.

The update is effective from 1 January 2024 with retrospective applica-
tion in accordance with IAS 8. The update allows a choice to early adopt the
update. The update is not expected to materially impact the existing classifi-
cation of liabilities. However, additional disclosures may be needed to com-
ply with subsequent events disclosure requirements included in this update.


### Amendment to IFRS 16: (September 2022)

In September 2022, the IASB amended IFRS 16 to require a seller-lessee to
measure lease liability in a way that ensures that an entity do not recognise
any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use it retains. This
amendment relates to sales and lease transactions.

The update is effective from 1 January 2024, with a choice for early adop-
tion. This amendment is not expected to have any impact on the Groups'
financial statements.


### Amendment to IAS 7 and IFRS 7: (May 2023)

In May 2023, the IASB issued guidance to disclose information around sup-
plier finance arrangements that assist users in understanding such arrange-
ments' impact on companies liabilities, cashflows and exposure to liquidity
risk. The disclosure requirements include both qualitative and quantitative
information.

The update is effective from 1 January 2024. The Group has no exposure
to supplier finance arrangements.


### Amendment to IAS 21: (August 2023)

The amendment provides guidance for foreign currency exposures where
foreign currency transactions are not readily available for a timely conver-
sion to other currencies. The amendment further provides guidance how to
identify such non-exchangeable currencies. In case an entity has exposure to
such non-exchangeable currency exposure, the amendment requires addi-
tional disclosure for users of the financial statements.

The update is effective from 1 January 2025, with an option to apply ear-
lier. The Group does not have any material exposure to non-exchangeable
foreign currency transactions.


### Significant Accounting Policies Applicable to Current and Prior Year: Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the
Group has control. The Group controls an entity where the Group is exposed
to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and
has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activi-
ties of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which
control is transferred to the Group. Subsidiaries are deconsolidated from the
date when the Group ceases control over such subsidiaries.

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business
combinations by the Group.

Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions
between group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also elimi-
nated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the trans-
ferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where
necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are
shown separately in the consolidated SOI, SOCI, SCE and SFP, respectively.


#### Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but
have neither control nor joint control. This is generally the case where the
Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in asso-
ciates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, after initially
being recognised at cost.


##### Joint Arrangements

Under IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, investments in joint arrangements are
classified as either joint operations or joint ventures (see Note 10. The clas-
sification depends on the contractual rights and obligations of each inves-
tor, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement. The Group have
investments both in joint ventures during the current reporting period. Joint
ventures are accounted for using the equity method, after initially being rec-
ognised at cost.


##### Equity Method

Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially rec-
ognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group's share of
the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in SOI, and the Group's
share of movements in other comprehensive income of the investee in SOCI.
Dividends received or receivable from associates and joint ventures are rec-
ognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment. Where the
Group's share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds
its interest in the entity, including any other unsecured long-term receivables,
the group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations

or made payments on behalf of other entities. Unrealised gains on transac-
tions between the group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated
to the extent of the group's interest in these entities. Unrealised losses are
also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment
of the asset(s) transferred. Accounting policies of equity-accounted invest-
ees have been changed where necessary to avoid material differences with
the Group's accounting policies. The carrying amount of equity-accounted
investments is tested for impairment if indicators exist that the carrying value
as at the reporting date may not be recovered.


### Changes in Ownership Interest

The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not
result in a loss of control as 'transactions with equity owners in their capacity
as owners' of the group. A change in ownership interest results in an adjust-
ment between the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling
interests to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference
between the non-controlling interests balance and any consideration paid
or received is recognised within equity attributable to owners of the Group.
When the Group ceases to consolidate or equity account for an investment
because of a loss of control, joint control or significant influence, any retained
interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value, with the change in car-
rying amount recognised in SOI. This fair value becomes the initial carrying
amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest
in an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts pre-
viously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity
are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets
or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other
comprehensive income are reclassified to SOI. If the ownership interest in a
joint venture or an associate is reduced but joint control or significant influ-
ence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously rec-
ognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to SOI.


### Foreign Currency Transactions

The Group applies IAS 21 Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates to all
foreign currency transactions.


### Functional and Presentation Currency

Items included in the financial statements of each of the group's entities are
measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which
the entity operates ('the functional currency').

The consolidated financial statements functional and presentation cur-
rency is SEK.


### Transactions and Balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency
using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange
gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from
the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign cur-
rencies at year end exchange rates, are generally recognised in profit or loss.
They are deferred in equity if they relate to qualifying cash flow hedges and
qualifying net investment hedges or are attributable to part of the net invest-
ment in a foreign operation. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair
value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date
when the fair value was determined.

Translation of the Financial Statements of Foreign Operations
The results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has
the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency
different from the presentation currency are translated into the Group's pre-
sentation currency as follows:

· Assets and liabilities in foreign operations, including goodwill and fair
value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are
translated at the closing rate at the SFP date.

· Income and expenses are translated at the average rates, which is
deemed a reasonable approximation of the rates prevailing at the transac-
tion dates.

· All resulting exchange differences are recognised directly in other com-
prehensive income.

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of any net
investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other financial instru-
ments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in other
comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is sold or any borrowings
forming part of the net investment are repaid, the associated exchange differ-
ences are reclassified to SOI, as part of the gain or loss on sale.


### Business Combinations

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business
combinations, regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are
acquired. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary
comprises the:

· fair values of the assets transferred

· liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business

· equity interests issued by the Group

· fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration
arrangement, and

· fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary.

Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed
in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at
their fair values at the acquisition date.

The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity
on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis at the non-controlling interest's pro-
portionate share of the acquired entity's net identifiable assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

The excess of the:

· consideration transferred;

· amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity; and

· acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired
entity over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded
as goodwill. If those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identifi-
able assets of the business acquired, the difference is recognised directly
in SOI as a bargain purchase.

Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts
payable in the future are discounted to their present value as at the date of
exchange. The discount rate used is the Group's incremental borrowing rate,

being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an inde-
pendent financier under comparable terms and conditions.

Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liabil-
ity. Amounts classified as a financial liability are subsequently remeasured to
fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in SOI.


### Goodwill

Goodwill is measured as described above. Goodwill on acquisitions of sub-
sidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortised, but it is
tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that it might be impaired and is carried at cost less
accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity
include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.

Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impair-
ment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups
of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business
combination in which the goodwill arose. The units or groups of units are
identified at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal man-
agement purposes, being the operating segments.


### Capitalized Software

Expenditures associated with maintaining software programs are expensed
as incurred. Development costs attributable to the design and testing of soft-
ware products under the Group's control and with anticipated future eco-
nomic benefits are capitalized if the following criteria are met:

. it is technically feasible to complete the software so that it will be avail-
able for use;

· there is a business case and financial feasibility to complete the software
and use it;

· there is a commercial need and no other better alternatives are available
except to complete the software;

· the completion of software will generate probable future economic ben-
efits to the Group;

· adequate technical, financial and other resources are committed to com-
plete the development of the software; and

· the expenditure attributable to the software during its development can
be reliably measured.

Directly attributable costs include staff costs and appropriate portion of
overheads. Borrowing costs are included in the cost of qualified fixed assets.
Additional expenditures for previously developed software, etc. are rec-
ognised as an asset if they increase the future economic benefits of the spe-
cific asset to which they are attributable, e.g., by improving or extending a
computer program's functionality beyond its original use and estimated use-
ful life.

IT development costs that are recognised as intangible assets are amor-
tised using the straight-line method over their useful lives (3-5 years). Useful
life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognised at cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment losses.

Client Servicing Assets

Client servicing assets represent the legal rights to servicing of non-per-
forming portfolios. These assets are recognised at fair value at the acquisi-
tion date. These assets are recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation

and impairment losses. These assets are amortised at straight line (5 to 10
years) over the contractual life if assets under management are expected to
remain stable or reduce in a linear manner. In case, the assets under manage-
ment have an accelerated diminishing profile in tail, then diminishing balance
method ranging from 10% to 30% is applied to match the profile of the assets
being serviced.


### Licenses

Separately acquired licenses are recognised at fair value. Licenses are
assessed as indefinite life asset if there is no limit assigned by the grant-
ing authority. In case if licenses expire at a certain date and then need to be
renewed, then such licenses are amortised over the grant period.


### Digital Servicing Platform

Digital Servicing Platform is an acquired intangible asset recognised at
fair value. The platform includes artificial intelligence and machine learn-
ing component. The platform has a decision engine that automates collec-
tion services and is expected to improve over time. The platform is assessed
as indefinite life asset and will be annually tested for impairment, similar to
Goodwill.


### Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at fair value. Sub-
sequent to initial recognition, the assets are reported at carrying amounts
less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Directly attributable
costs to bring the assets to usable conditions are recognised to the carrying
amount on initial recognition.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or rec-
ognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that
future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group
and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of
any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognised when
replaced. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to SOI during the
reporting period in which they are incurred.

Depreciation is booked on a straight-line basis over the asset's anticipated
useful life (3-5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually.

An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable
amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recover-
able amount.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds
with carrying amount. These are included in SOI.


### Property Holdings

In connection with acquisitions of secured PIs and in connection with the
recovery of collateral for acquired receivables, the Group may become own-
ers of property holdings or other physical goods. These assets are acquired
as part of normal operating cycle for subsequent disposal and realisation
of proceeds as collections. Accordingly, these form part of working capital
and are classified as 'Inventories' in SFP. These are stated at the lower of cost
and net realisable value. Any write downs are recognised in 'Other Oper-
ating Items', whilst sale proceeds and carrying amounts are derecognised
are reported in 'Income' and 'Direct Costs' line in SOI, when the sale is
completed.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of
business less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

### Right of Use Assets

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:

· the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;

· any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any
lease incentives received;

· any initial direct costs, and

· restoration costs.


### Impairment

Goodwill, Licenses and Digital Servicing Platform have an indefinite use-
ful life and are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or
changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired.

Other assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in cir-
cumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An
impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carry-
ing amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the
higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the
purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for
which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely inde-
pendent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash-gen-
erating units). Non-financial assets, other than Goodwill, that were previously
written down due to impairment loss(es) are reviewed for possible reversal of
the impairment at the end of each reporting period.


### Financial assets

Classification

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement
categories:

· those to be measured subsequently at fair value through profit or loss; and

· those to be measured at amortised cost.

The classification depends on the Group's business model for managing the
financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.

For assets that are measured at fair value, gains and losses on subsequent
remeasurements are recognised in SOI.


#### Recognition and derecognition

Financial assets are recognised on trade date, being the date on which
the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are
derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets
have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred sub-
stantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.


### Measurement

At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value
plus, in the case of a financial asset not recognised at Fair Value through
Profit or Loss ("FVPL"), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the
acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets that are
recognised at FVPL are expensed in SOI.

Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group's
business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of
the asset. The Group uses following two measurement categories to classify
its debt instruments:

· Amortised Cost: Assets that are managed under 'hold to collect busi-

ness model and the underlying cash flows represent solely payments of
principal and interest, are measured at amortised cost. Interest income
from these financial assets is included in 'Finance Income' using the EIR
method, if these asset relate to treasury operations, otherwise these are
recognised within 'Income' as these are part of 'Investing' business seg-
ment. Any gain or loss on such instruments is recognised directly in SOI -
these are reported in 'Other Operating Items' if such gains or losses relate
to 'Investing' business segment; or in 'Net Financial Expenses' if such gains
or losses relate to treasury operations.

· FVPL: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost are mea-
sured at FVPL. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently
measured at FVPL is recognised in SOI similar to the aforementioned
Amortised Cost description.


#### Portfolio Investments

Portfolio Investments ("Pls") consist of portfolios of delinquent receivables
purchased at prices significantly below the nominal outstanding balance.
In accordance with IFRS 9, these are classified as Purchased or Originated
Credit Impaired ("POCI"). Pls usually refer to receivables from private indi-
viduals and companies and are either secured or unsecured receivables.
They are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at cred-
it-adjusted Effective Interest Rate ("EIR") amortised cost method. The EIR
of a POCI loan portfolio would be the discount rate that equates the pres-
ent value of the expected cash flows with the purchase price of the portfo-
lio. Expected cash flows are measured on gross basis including the expected
loan repayments, reminder fees, collection fees and late interest payments,
based on a probability assessment, are expected to be received from the
loan portfolio's customers.

The initial lifetime Expected Credit Losses (ECL) are included in the esti-
mated cash flows when calculating the credit-adjusted EIR and are implied
at initial recognition. Cash flow projections are monitored over the course of
the year and updated based on, among other things, lifetime performance,
servicer outlook, regulatory and other relevant macro environment data.
Cash flow projections are made at the segment level (portfolio or subportfo-
lio) assuming each segment to be relatively homogeneous. Any subsequent
changes in lifetime ECL, both positive and negative, are recognised in SOI as
credit gains and losses. Credit gains and losses arise due to timing (acceler-
ated or decelerated collections) and quantum (over or under performance)
differences when compared to the original forecast.

Interest income from PIs is recognised under the credit-adjusted EIR
method in SOI

In case of sale of Pls, then sale proceeds are reported as 'Interest Income'.


### ECLs for other financial assets

The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the ECLs reserve associ-
ated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost. For trade receiv-
ables, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted under IFRS 9,
which requires lifetime ECLs to be recognised from initial recognition of the
receivables.


### Derivatives

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative con-
tract is entered into, and they are subsequently remeasured to their fair value
at the end of each reporting period. The accounting for subsequent changes
in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging

instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group desig-
nates certain derivatives as either:

· hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commit-
ment (fair value hedges);

· hedges of a particular risk associated with the cash flows of recognised
assets and liabilities and highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow
hedges); or

· hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedges).

At inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the economic
relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, including
whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instruments are expected
to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items. The Group docu-
ments its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge
transactions.

The fair values of derivative financial instruments designated in hedge
relationships are disclosed in Note 28.The full fair value of a hedging deriva-
tive is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining matu-
rity of the derivative is more than 12 months; it is classified as a current asset
or liability when the remaining maturity of the derivative item is less than 12
months.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are
designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in the cash flow
hedge reserve within equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective por-
tion is recognised immediately in SOI, within 'Net Financial Expenses' line.

When forward contracts are used to hedge forecast transactions, the
Group generally designates only the changes in fair value of the forward con-
tract related to the spot component as the hedging instrument. Gains or
losses relating to the effective portion of the change in the spot component
of the forward contracts are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within
equity. The change in the forward element of the contract that relates to the
hedged item ('aligned forward element') is recognised within SOCI in the
costs of hedging reserve within equity.

Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified in the periods when the
hedged item affects profit or loss.

Investments in foreign subsidiaries (net assets ) are hedged through loans
in foreign currency or forward exchange contracts. Hedges of net invest-
ments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of
the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in
reserves in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is rec-
ognised immediately in SOI within 'Net Financial Expenses' line.

Hedging instruments' effective gains and losses accumulated in equity
are reclassified to SOI when foreign operation(s) are partially or wholly
derecognised (sold or liquidated).


### Servicing Outlays

The Group incurs various outlays for court fees, legal representation,
enforcement authorities, etc., as part of servicing operations. These costs are
mainly incurred under three arrangements: Agent; Principal and Fiduciary
capacities:

· Agent: Where the costs incurred to collect outstanding debts and subse-
quently collections are fully transferred to clients. Therefore, the Group
bears no risk other than a credit risk to collect this amount from clients,
then such costs are netted within 'Other Operating Items' in SOI. The
75
Annual and Sustainability Report 2023
About Intrum Strategy How we operate Governance and control Board of Directors' Report Financial statements Sustainability information

Group only is entitled to a commission fee for carrying out these tasks on
behalf of its clients;

· Principal: Where the costs incurred to collect outstanding debts and
subsequently collections are not fully transferred to clients. Therefore,
the Group bears the risks of incurring such outlays with an expectation
of retaining a significant fee from subsequent collection from custom-
ers. In addition, in certain cases, The Group has agreements with its cli-
ents where any expenses that cannot be collected from debtors are
instead refunded by the clients - costs under these arrangements are also
assessed as acting in the capacity of a principal. Therefore, the Group
bears full risk of this servicing activity and will be remunerated mainly from
the subsequent collections, then such costs are included within 'Direct
Costs' line and any subsequent recoveries from clients or customers are
included with 'Income' line in SOI; or

· Fiduciary Capacity: Where the Group is assigned client bank accounts
funded by clients to incur costs to collect outstanding debts. The Group
only acts in a fiduciary capacity and carries out these tasks in compliance
with a pre-defined arrangement. These costs are not recognised in SOI.

The amount that is expected to be recovered from a solvent counterparty is
recognised as an asset (see Note 14). The legal outlays are recognised at their
fair value, which is the amount of that can be claimed, unless they contain sig-
nificant financing components. Legal outlays are subsequently measures at
amortised cost.


### Fiduciary Assets / Liabilities

Client funds, which are reported as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet,
represent cash received on collection of a specific debt on behalf of a client
and payable to the client within a specified period.


### Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and Cash Equivalents consist of cash in hand, deposits held at call with
financial institutions, other short-term highly liquid investments with origi-
nal maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known
amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in
value and bank overdrafts.

Certain bank accounts are restricted, where the Group does not have
unrestricted right to withdraw cash. These are referred as 'Restricted Bank
Accounts' and are not reported as Cash and Cash Equivalents. Instead, these
are disclosed as 'Other Financial Assets' (see Note 12).


### Borrowing

Borrowings include bond loans and liability to financial institutions - these
are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. They
are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any difference between
the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is rec-
ognised in SOI over the contractual period of the Borrowings using the EIR
method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as
transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all
of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the
draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that
some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalized as a pre-
payment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility
to which it relates. Borrowings are removed from SFP, when the obligation
specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled, extinguished or expired.


### Leasing

Assets and liabilities arising from a leasing contract are initially measured on
a present value basis, except for short-term leases having a contractual term
of 12 months or less and leases with a value of Euro 5k or less. Lease liabilities
include the net present value of the following lease payments:

· fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease
incentives receivable;

· variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate, initially mea-
sured using the index;

· or rate as at the commencement date;

· amounts expected to be payable by the group under residual value
guarantees;

· the exercise price of a purchase option if the group is reasonably certain
to exercise that option; and

· payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects
the group exercising that option.

Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are
also included in the measurement of the liability.

Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The
finance cost is charged to SOI over the lease period so as to produce a con-
stant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for
each period.


### Taxes

Income taxes expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the cur-
rent period's taxable income, based on the applicable income tax rate for
each jurisdiction, adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities
attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws
enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in the
countries where the company and its subsidiaries operate and generate
taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax
returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is sub-
ject to interpretation and considers whether it is probable that a taxation
authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment. The Group measures its
tax balances either based on the most likely amount or the expected value,
depending on which method provides a better prediction of the resolution of
the uncertainty.

Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on tem-
porary differences arising between the carrying amount of assets and liabili-
ties and their tax base. However, deferred taxes are not accounted for if they
arise from the initial reporting of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets
and liabilities in a transaction other than a business combination which, at
the time of the transaction, does not affect either the accounting or taxable
profit or loss and does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible tempo-
rary differences.

Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognised for temporary differ-
ences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments in foreign
operations where the company is able to control the timing of the reversal
of the temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not
reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax is determined by applying the tax rates and laws that have
been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and

are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised,
or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets from deductible temporary differences and tax-loss
carry forwards are only recognised if it is probable that future taxable income
will be available to utilize those temporary differences and losses.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally
enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and where the
deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority.

Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally
enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Current and deferred taxes are recognised in the stand alone and consol-
idated SOIs unless they relate to items recognised directly in other compre-
hensive income or directly in equity. In this case the taxes are also recognised
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.


### Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obliga-
tion as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will
be required to settle the obligation and an amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are not recognised for future losses.

Provisions are measured at the present value of management's best esti-
mate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end
of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present
value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provi-
sion due to the passage of time is recognised as interest expense.


### Employee benefits Short-term benefits

Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits, annual
leave and accumulating sick leave that are expected to be settled wholly
within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render
the related service are recognised in respect of employees' services up to the
end of the reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected to be
paid when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are presented as current
other liabilities in the SFP.


### Long term obligation

The Group granted certain employees long term benefits that vests over a
three-year period . Eligible employees may be granted up to certain percent-
age of their annual base salary if certain performance conditions are met at
the end of the vesting period. The liabilities are presented as non-current lia-
bilities in the SFP. These obligations are therefore measured as the value of
expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by
employees up to the end of the reporting period.


### Post-employment benefits

The Group operates various post-employment schemes, including both
defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.

The liability or asset recognised in SFP in respect of defined benefit pen-
sion plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end
of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined ben-
efit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the
projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obli-
gation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using
76
Annual and Sustainability Report 2023
About Intrum Strategy How we operate Governance and control Board of Directors' Report Financial statements Sustainability information

interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the
currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms approximat-
ing to the terms of the related obligation.

The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net
balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets.
This cost is included in employee benefit expense in SOI.

Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and
changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they
occur, directly in other comprehensive income. They are included in SOCI
and SCE.

Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting
from plan amendments or curtailments are recognised immediately in SOI as
past service costs.

For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or
privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual
or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the
contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee
benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as
an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments
is available.


### Multi-employer pension plan

The Group participates in a multi-employer pension plans for specified
Swedish employees. According to the SFRB, UFR 10, the Group accounts for
its participation in the plan as if it were a defined contribution plan as suffi-
cient information on its proportional share of plan assets, liabilities and costs
are not available to the Group. There is no contractual agreement that states
how surpluses and deficits in the plan are to be distributed among plan par-
ticipants. The premium is individually calculated, depending on salary, pre-
viously vested pension and anticipated remaining term of employment. The
Group pays a regular premium amount to Alecta (Swedish insurance com-
pany) which manages these multi-employer Swedish pension plans.


### Share-based payments

Share-based compensation benefits are provided to employees via the
Group Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), under which eligible employees may
be granted up to certain percentage of their annual base salary, worth of fully
paid ordinary shares in the Company for no cash consideration.

The fair value of shares is recognised as an employee benefits expense,
with a corresponding increase in equity. The total amount to be expensed is
determined by reference to the fair value of the shares granted which:

· Includes any market performance conditions (e.g., to total shareholders
return);

· excludes the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting
conditions (e.g., EPS targets and remaining an employee of the entity over
a specified time period); and

· includes the impact of any non-vesting conditions (e.g., the requirement
for employees to save or hold shares for a specific period of time).

The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period
over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the
end of each period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of shares
that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting and service con-
ditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in
profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

The LTIP includes a net settlement feature under which the shares neces-
sary to settle the employee's tax obligations are withheld by the Group which
transfer amount of taxes associated with a share-based payment to the tax
authority on the employee's behalf.


### Treasury shares

The Group repurchases its own shares and holds them in treasury, mainly to
transfer these shares to specified employees as part of share-based remu-
neration plan:

· On initial purchase, the amount paid for the treasury shares is recognised
in Treasury Shares Reserve account (negative balance within the equity
balance);

. No gain or loss is recognised in SOI on the purchase, sale, issue or can-
cellation of own equity instruments. The acquisition and subsequent
resale of treasury shares are transactions with the Group's owners, rather
than a commercial transaction resulting in gain or loss to the Group. In
case, where the shares are transferred to employees then the cost for
such shares is reclassified to Retained Earnings account within the equity
balance;

· Consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of an entity's own
equity instruments are recognised directly in equity. The net difference
between the purchase and sale price is reclassified to Retained Earnings
within the equity balance; and

. On cancellation of treasury shares, the purchase price in reclassified to
Retained Earnings within the equity balance (see Note 23).


### Dividends

Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropri-
ately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the entity, on or before
the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the report-
ing period.


### Revenue recognition

The Group applies IFRS 15 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" for
income earned from the servicing business.

Income consisting of commissions and collection fees is recognised on
collection of the claim. Subscription income is recognised proportionately
over the term of the underlying service contracts, which is usually one year.

Most servicing income are recognised when the relative performance obli-
gation is fulfilled (point-in-time recognition). Income from property sales is
recognised when the buyer gains access to the property.

Certain servicing contracts entitle the Group to additional contingent
income if certain parameters are not fulfilled, like a certain minimum level of
non-performing loans are not transferred to the Group in a specified period.
In this case, the Group recognises income applying variable consideration
guidance. Total contingent income is estimated over the remaining contrac-
tual life and income is recognised to the extent, which highly unlikely to be
reversed in future (see Note 4).


### Segment reporting

The Group applies IFRS 8 Operating Segments. Operating segments are
reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the
Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). The Group CEO has been identi-
fied as CODM.

The Group has identified two business segments: Servicing and Invest-

ing. These operating segments are further sub-divided into four geographi-
cal segments:

· Northern Markets (4 markets): 'Norway', 'Sweden', 'Denmark' and 'Finland'

· Middle Markets (5 markets): 'Austria & Germany', 'Belgium & Netherlands',
'Switzerland', 'France' and 'UK & Ireland'

· Southern Markets (4 markets): 'Portugal', 'Spain', 'Italy' and 'Greece'

· Tactical Markets (4 markets): 'Czech Republic', 'Slovakia', 'Hungary' and
'Poland'


### Parent Company's accounting principles

The Parent Company has prepared the Annual Report according to the
Annual Accounts Act (1995:1554) and RFR 2 Accounting for Legal Entities
form the Swedish Financial Reporting Board. RFR 2 means that the Parent
Company, in the annual report of the legal entity, must apply all EU-approved
IFRS and statements as far as possible with the framework of the Accounts
Act and taking into the account the connection between reporting and tax-
ation. The recommendation specifies exemptions or additions relative to
EU-adopted IFRS.

The differences between the Group's and Parent Company's account-
ing principles are indicated below. The accounting principles for the Parent
Company as stated below have been applied consistently to all periods pre-
sented in the Parent Company's financial statements.

Subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures
Shares in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures are rec-
ognised by the Parent Company at cost (included transaction costs). There-
after they are measured under Equity Method (Cost plus income accrued
less income received). Income may include dividend, interest, princi-
pal repayments etc. Impairment is assessed on a regular basis and are rec-
ognised when it is highly likely that the investment will not be recovered in
full.

Group contributions and shareholders' contributions for legal entities
The company reports group contributions and shareholder' contribu-
tions in accordance with the statements of RFR 2 of the Swedish Financial
Reporting Board. Group contributions paid are recognised as sharehold-
ers' contributions. Shareholders' contributions are recognised directly in
the shareholders' equity of the receiving entity and capitalised in the shares
and participating interest of the contributor, to the extent impairment is not
required.

## Note 3 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions:

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with EU-adopted
IFRSs require the use of certain critical accounting estimates and judgements
which influence the value of assets and liabilities as well as income and costs
reported in the consolidated SFP and in the consolidated SOI, respectively or
the disclosures included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements
in relation to potential assets and liabilities existing as of the date the consoli-
dated financial statements were authorised for issue.

The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving esti-
mations (which are presented separately below) that the management have
made in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies and that
have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial
statements.


## Provisions:

The determination of the amount of the accruals requires judgment by man-
agement based on available documentation and information on potential
liabilities.


## Control Assessment:

The Group regularly assesses control over its investees to determine whether
such investees should be consolidated in the Group's financial statements.
The assessment includes assessment of economic, operational and gover-
nance factors which may or may not be aligned with the legal structure of
such investments. Significant judgements are required in control assessment,
mainly for investments where the relevant factors are not fully aligned with
the underlying legal structure.

· Since 2006, the Group has operations in Poland structured through
investment funds to comply with the local regulation. The investments
funds purchase and hold portfolio investments. The Group has control
over these funds and thus the funds are consolidated in the Group's finan-
cial statements.

· Post 2021 and 2022 restructuring, the Group continues to have joint con-
trol over the Ithaca JV and accordingly, the co-investment is not consoli-
dated in the Group's financial statements.


## Climate Related Risks

The Group is not directly exposed to any material climate related risks. The
climate related risks are evaluated in relation to portfolio investments and
regularly assessed as part of our revaluation process. For example, collateral
values are timely adjusted where objective evidence is available that such
assets would be impacted by climate related risks like real estate assets situ-
ated in areas exposed to high environmental risks.

Estimates are based on historical experience and other factors. The result-
ing accounting estimates could differ from the related actual results. Esti-
mates are periodically reviewed, and the effects of each change are reflected
in the consolidated income statement in the period in which the change
occurs.

The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of esti-
mation uncertainty at the reporting period that may have a significant risk of
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
within the next financial year are discussed below.


## Valuation of Goodwill:

Goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test. This calculation requires
management's judgment based on information available within the Group
and the market, as well as own past experience. There is an increased mea-
surement uncertainty due to challenging macro-economic environment and
changes to the Group's business strategies.


## Portfolio Investments:

The measurement of Pls is based on the Group's own projection of future
cash flows from the acquired portfolios incorporating factors relating to
macroeconomic environments, types of debtors and loan (e.g., secures/
unsecured). Future projections are periodically reviewed and any changes in
the estimated cash flows are ultimately authorised by a central revaluation
committee.


## Useful Lives of Non-financial Assets:

The useful lives and the amortisation / depreciation method of non-financial
assets are assessed on an annual basis. These assets are exposed to impair-
ments, which are tested annual to ensure that values are not misstated.


## Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets:

The valuation of deferred tax assets is based on forecasted results which
depend upon factors that could vary over time and could have significant
effects on the valuation of deferred tax assets.


## Income Taxes:

The Group is subject to different tax jurisdictions. The determination of
tax liabilities for the Group requires the use of assumptions with respect to
transactions whose fiscal consequences are not yet certain at the end of the
reporting period. The Group recognises liabilities which could result from
future inspections by the fiscal authorities on the basis of an estimate of the
amounts expected to be paid to the taxation authorities. If the result of the
abovementioned inspections differs from that estimated by Group manage-
ment, there could be significant effects on both current and deferred taxes.


## Macro-economic Environment

The current macro-economic environment creates significant measurement
uncertainty relating to key assumptions, including WACC, inflation, eco-
nomic output growth, developments of Non-Performing Loan ("NPLs") vol-
umes, future performance of NPLs and long-term growth rates. Significant
changes in expectations, such as a protracted recession or inflation rebound-
ing, could result in material changes to these assumptions. Consequently,
revisions to these metrics could materially impact future valuation amounts
reported on our SFP.


## Acquisitions

In 2023, the Group made several acquisitions. As part of the purchase price
allocation, management assessed the fair value of the acquired assets lead-
ing to fair value adjustments. The fair value measurement of the acquirees'
net assets involved estimates. Management estimated the fair value based
on the cash flows that the underlying assets were expected to generate over
their useful lives. The valuation of the acquirees' net assets comprises the
present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at a rate of return
that considers the risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of
money.

During 2023, our costs increased in excess of our income growth, which is
mainly due to the increase in the personnel expenses as a result of wage infla-
tion under the deteriorating macroeconomic environment. Moreover, the
cost saving program launched in 2023 also led to consultancy and reorgani-
sation costs.

Salaries also include remuneration in forms other than cash payments, such
as a free or subsidised car, housing and meals. For information on number of
employees and compensation to the Group's senior executives, see Note 31
and 33, respectively.

Pension expenses include an amount of SEK 16 (21) million relating to
defined contribution plans. See Note 18 for more information on defined
benefit plans.

For more information on amortisation and depreciation expenses, see
Note 8 and 11, respectively.

The Group has operations in more than 20 European countries, each with
various tax rates. The current tax expense for the year relates mainly to
income taxes in Switzerland, Greece, Hungary, Norway, Germany and Italy.
The Group's Swedish companies paid no income tax for the year, as they
were able to utilise tax loss carryforwards from historical losses.

The parent company Intrum AB is seated in Sweden where the nomi-
nal corporate tax rate in 2023 was 20.6% (20.6%) The following reconcili-
ation explains the difference between the Group's actual tax cost and the
expected tax cost taking the Swedish corporate tax rate into account:

Unrecognised tax assets regarding tax loss carryforwards relate to the nega-
tive tax effect attributable to losses in countries where no deferred tax asset
is recognised because it is not probable that enough taxable surplus to uti-
lize the tax losses will arise within the foreseeable future. Utilised previously
unrecognised tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards correspond to the
positive tax effect over the year arising from the utilisation of tax loss carry-
forwards, not previously recognised as deferred tax assets.

The difference between the Swedish nominal corporate tax rate, 20.6%,
and the 2023 effective tax rate, 66.2%, is primarily an effect of higher
amounts of losses in entities that have not been able to recognize corre-
sponding deferred tax assets (Spain & the UK) and increase in non-deduct-
ible interest in Sweden and non-deductible costs in Italy.


## Deferred tax assets and liabilities

When temporary differences arise between the tax value and carry-
ing value of assets and liabilities, a deferred tax asset or tax liability is rec-
ognised in accordance with the criteria of IAS 12. Such temporary differences
mainly arise for portfolio investments, provisions for pensions and intangi-
ble assets. Deferred tax assets include the value of tax loss carryforwards in
the instances where they are likely to be utilised to offset taxable surpluses
within the foreseeable future.

The deferred tax assets and income tax liabilities are expected to be due for
payment more than one year in the future. Deferred tax assets are reported
in the balance sheet when it is expected to be possible to offset the tax loss
carryforwards against taxable profits within the foreseeable future or if there
are other taxable temporary differences towards the same taxing authority.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reported as a net amount if they relate
to the same tax authority or are planned to be utilised simultaneously.

Tax expenses reported in other comprehensive income, FX effects and
acquisitions during the year amounted to SEK -129 M (-245), of which SEK 58 M
pertained to currency hedging, SEK -17 M to reversal of a tax provision and
SEK-170 M pertained to revaluations of pension provisions, acquisitions and
other foreign currency exchange translation differences.

Tax-exempted revenue and non-deductible expenses in the Parent Com-
pany consist primarily of dividends, non-deductible interest and impair-
ment of shares. The Parent company had at 31 December 2023 accumulated
interest carryforward of SEK 2,263 M, which has not been recognised as a
deferred tax asset.

## Pillar Two Income Taxes


### Temporary exception

The group has applied the temporary exception issued by the IASB in May
2023 from the accounting requirements for deferred taxes in IAS12. Accord-
ingly, the group neither recognises nor discloses information about deferred
tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.


### Work to date

The group has performed a detailed scoping and safe harbour assessment
for all relevant jurisdictions and entities. According to the assessment, the
majority of jurisdictions where the group conducts business will be eligible
for the transitional safe harbours.


### Divestments impacting Pillar Two Income Taxes

On 22 January 2024, Intrum announced the signing of the divestment of a
material portion of its investment portfolio, which includes assets from sev-
eral jurisdictions. This divestment is expected to significantly decrease
Intrum's profits subject to top-up tax. Consequently, any potential top-up tax
liability will also decrease due to the divestment.


### Potential top-up tax if the legislation were enacted

On 13 December 2023, the government of Sweden, where Intrum AB (the
parent company) is incorporated, enacted the Pillar Two income tax legis-
lation effective from 1 January 2024. Under the legislation, Intrum AB will
be required to pay top-up tax in Sweden on profits of its subsidiaries that
are taxed at an effective tax rate of less than 15%. Following the announced
divestment, the only jurisdiction in which Intrum's exposure to this tax may
exist is Poland. As of 31 December 2023, approximately SEK 130 M of annual
profits may be subject to the tax, which are currently taxed at the average
effective tax rate applicable to those profits of 4%. This information is based
on the profits and tax expense determined as part of the preparation of the
group's consolidated financial statements, considering only certain adjust-
ments that would have been required by applying the legislation, namely
dividends, net tax expense, adjusted deferred tax to 15% and adjusted for a

substance carve-out relating to personnel expenses. Because not all of the
adjustments required by the legislation were made, the actual impact that
the Pillar Two income tax legislation would have had on the group's results if
it had been in effect for the year ending 31 December 2023 may have been
significantly different.

The Group is continuing to assess the impact of the Pillar Two income tax
legislation on its future financial performance.

## Reallocation of Goodwill

Following changes to corporate strategy and group reorganisation, the good-
will balance has been reallocated to 'Austria & Germany', 'Belgium & Nether-
lands', 'Czech Republic, Romania & Slovakia', 'Finland', 'France', 'Hungary',
'Poland', 'Portugal', 'Norway', 'Sweden', 'Denmark', 'Switzerland' and 'UK &
Ireland', Spain', 'Italy' and 'Greece' Markets in 2023.

The goodwill balances have been reallocated on the relative recoverable
value estimates as at 31 December 2023 for current and comparative report-
ing periods.

The goodwill balances are annually assessed for impairment by comparing
carrying amounts to value-in-use estimates. These estimates are measured
based on post-tax cash flow forecasts. These forecasts are based on his-
torical results adjusted with current assumptions and future trends for each
respective CGUs.

The value-in-use estimates are based on a 5-year forecasting period. The
forecasting period includes steady growth rates applied to the initial period,
whilst diminishing growth rates are applied to later periods. At the end of 5th
year, a terminal value is estimated to reflect the value relating to future period
in perpetuity. The value-in-estimate is a total of forecasting period and termi-
nal value discounted at post-tax WACC.


## Key Assumptions

The value-in-use estimates are based on following key assumptions:


<table>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>2023</th>
<th>2022</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WACC (Post-tax)</td>
<td>7.2% to 11.1%</td>
<td>7.5%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tax Rate</td>
<td>15.4% to 27.9%</td>
<td>22.0%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Growth Rate</td>
<td>-5.4% to 19.1%</td>
<td>3.6% to 12.9%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Terminal Growth Rate</td>
<td>2,0%</td>
<td>2,5%</td>
</tr>
</table>


### WACC Sensitivity

WACC is one of the key inputs to compute the value-in-use estimates. Following sensitivity analysis highlights changes to the headroom between goodwill bal-
ance and value-in-use estimates if WACC changes by 50 Basis Points ("BPS"), whist assuming no change to Terminal Growth Rate ("TGR"):

## Client Servicing Contracts

The customer contracts were acquired as part of a busines combination in
Italy, Spain and Greece. They are recognized at their fair value at the date
of acquisition and are subsequently amortized on a diminishing balance
method.


## Capitalised Development Expenses

It mainly relates to internally developed production system used by the
Group in its Servicing business.

#### Ithaca Investment DAC

In 2018, Intrum acquired 80% of the Profit Participating Notes (PPNs) issued
by Ithaca Investment DAC (Ithaca), an entity joint-controlled with Car-
Val Investors. Ithaca invested in 51% of junior and mezzanine notes ("the
Notes") issued by the Italian special purpose vehicle (SPV) Penelope SPV
S.R.L. (Penelope), to finance the acquisition of a portfolio of Non-performing
Loans (NPLs) sold by Banca Intesa Sanpaolo (hereinafter "ISP"). ISP hold the
remaining 49% of the Notes and the senior note. Intrum's ultimate economic
entitlement in the Notes was 40.8%.

On 29 December 2021, Penelope was restructured and refinanced with
longer duration, rated, senior notes. The senior notes were later guaranteed
through the Garanzia Cartolarizzazione Sofferenze, typically referred to as
GACS. As part of the restructuring, Ithaca's holding in the Notes increased
from 51% to 95%. In addition, Intrum reduced its holdings in the PPNs issued
by Ithaca from 80% to 62.5%. This resulted in an overall increase in Intrum's
economic entitlement of the mezzanine notes from 40.8% to 59.4%.

On 24 November 2022, CarVal Investors sold their stake in Ithaca to Kiste-
fos which lead to a material write-down of the joint venture.


## Evolve Spv Srl

In March 2021, Intrum acquired 20% of untranched notes issued by Evolve
Spv SRL (Evolve), an entity jointly controlled with Deva Capital. Evolve pur-
chased a portfolio on NPLs from an Italian bank, BPER Banca.


## Portland Srl

In November 2021, Intrum acquired 28.5% of Mezzanine and Junior notes
issued by Portland SRL (Portland), an entity jointly controlled with Deva Cap-
ital. Portland purchased a portfolio on NPLs from ISP.


## Northwind Investments Holdings, S.L.U.

In December 2018, Intrum acquired 50% equity in Northwind Investments
Holdings (Northwind), an entity jointly controlled with Napier. Northwind
ultimately owns 80% of Global Zappa, owner of a portfolio of real estate pur-
chased from a Spanish bank, Ibercaja. Intrum's economic entitlement is 40%.

In 2023, due to poor performance and imminent debt maturity, we
impaired the asset in full.


## Greek Securitization vehicles

During 2021 and 2022, Intrum acquired between 30% - 49% share of mez-
zanine and junior notes issued by Phoenix NPL Finance DAC, Vega I NPL
Finance DAC, Vega II NPL Finance DAC, Vega III NPL Finance DAC, Sunrise
I NPL Finance DAC and Sunrise II NPL Finance DAC ("the SPVs"). The SPVs
purchased portfolios of NPLs from Piraeus Bank. Piraeus Bank also invested
in the senior notes issued by the SPVs which are guaranteed under the Hel-
lenic Asset Protection Scheme (HAPS).

The Greek SPVs' summarised financial information is based on estimated
amounts as information was not available at the time of issuing this report.


## I-LAW STA Srl

In 2022, Intrum acquired 33% equity in I-LAW STA Srl. I-LAW STA Srl is a law
firm specialising in legal collection services.

The tables below provide summarised financial information for the joint
ventures which the Group deems significant. The information disclosed

In the Netherlands, a VAT receivable arises in connection with portfolio invest-
ments. The VAT portion of the acquired receivable can be recovered from the
tax authorities if it is not collected from the end-customer and is therefore rec-
ognised as a separate receivable. The portion that is expected to be recovered
within 12 months is recognised as current. In the Netherlands, bailiffs are private
companies and expenses for collection cases paid to them can sometimes be
recovered from the bailiffs if their collection measures fail. When it emerges that
Intrum is entitled to request that the amount be returned from the enforcement
authorities, the amount is moved from Outlays on behalf of clients, to recover
from enforcement authorities.

Expense for the Period and Interest Income are recognised in SOI. Return on
Plan Assets, Actuarial Assumptions (Gains) / Losses and Foreign Exchange
Difference are recognised in SOCI. Net Payment for the Period is recognised
in SOCF.

Group employees in Switzerland, and certain employees in Germany, are
covered by pension plans funded through assets under the management of
insurance companies and are reported as defined benefit plans. In particular
in Switzerland, the Group has an commitment to fund service pension plans
funded through insurance policies based on the Swiss Life Collective BVG
Foundation and in Transparent BVG Foundation. The pension commitment is
funded through insurance contracts.

Employees in Germany, Norway, France, Greece and Italy are covered by
unfunded defined benefit plans that can be paid out as a one-time sum or as
monthly payments following retirement.

Pension plans in Belgium and Sweden are funded through insurance
contracts.

Regarding Sweden, the Group is covered by collective agreement (Almega
/ Unionen / Akademikerförbunden) and is obliged to ensure collective
agreed pensions and insurance for its employees. The pension plan is called
ITP and made of ITP 1 which includes employees born in 1979 or later and
ITP2 which covers employees born in 1978 or earlier. ITP 1 is a defined contri-
bution plan.

For salaried employees in Sweden, the ITP 2 plan's defined benefit pension
obligations for old-age and family pension (or family pension) are secured
through an insurance policy with Alecta. According to a statement from the
Swedish Financial Reporting Board, UFR 10 Reporting of ITP 2 pension plan
financed through insurance with Alecta, this is a multi-employer defined
benefit plan. For the financial year 2023, the company did not have access
to the information required in order to report its proportionate share of the
plan's obligations, plan assets and costs, which meant that the plan could
not be recognised as a defined benefit plan. The ITP 2 pension plan, which is
secured through insurance with Alecta, is therefore recognised as a defined
contribution plan. The premium for the defined benefit old-age and family
pension is individually calculated and is dependent, among other things, on
salary, previously earned pension and expected remaining period of service.
The expected contributions in the next reporting period for ITP 2 insurance
policies taken out with Alecta amount to SEK 10 million (2022: SEK 11 mil-
lion). The Group's share of the total contributions to the plan and the Group's
share of the total number of active members in the plan are 0.06 and 0.04%
respectively (2022: 0.05 and 0.04% respectively).

The collective funding level is the market value of Alecta's assets as a per-
centage of the insurance liabilities calculated using Alecta's actuarial meth-
ods and assumptions, which are not in accordance with IAS 19. The collective
funding level should normally be permitted to vary between 125 and 175%.
One measure that could be taken to strengthen the funding level if it is
deemed too low, is to increase the contractual price for new subscriptions
and the extension of existing benefits. If the funding level exceeds 150%, pre-
mium reductions can be introduced. At the end of 2023, Alecta's surplus in
terms of the collective funding level was 158% (2022: 172%).

Intrum AB is financed through a revolving syndicated loan facility, bonds,
bilateral loans and commercial papers. The loan facility of EUR 1.8 billion is
arranged with a banking consortium comprising 14 banks and applies until
January 2026. The loan facility contains operations-related and financial
covenants, including limits on specific financial indicators. In addition, the
credit agreement includes covenants that may restrict, condition or prohibit
the Group from incurring additional debt, making acquisitions, disposing of
assets, making capital and finance lease expenditures, allowing assets to be
encumbered, changing the scope of the Group's business and entering into
a merger agreement. The loan carries a variable interest rate based on the
interbank rate in each currency, with a margin. All operational and financial
covenants were fully met in 2023. As of 31 December 2023, the loan frame-
work had been utilised in the total amount of SEK 13,834 M (8,503), which
can be broken down into SEK 11,044 M, NOK 1,140 M and EUR 150 M. In addi-
tion, NOK 59 M of the total frame is reserved for Guarantees.

The unutilised portion of the revolving credit facility amounted to SEK
5,089 M (11,452). In November 2023, Intrum entered into a bilateral secured
term loan facility with an International bank, the balance of the loan was
EUR 100 M as of 31 December 2023. The proceeds of the bilateral loan were
applied towards general corporate purposes, including refinancing of exist-
ing debt.

As of year-end 2023 Intrum had outstanding nominal value of bonds total-
ing SEK 44,574 M (47,289) whereof SEK 5,250 M are issued under the Swed-
ish MTN programme, SEK 1,387 M are private placements and the remaining
SEK 37,937 are bonds issued in the Euro market. In June 2023 Intrum issued
a 2 year SEK 1,100 M floating MTN with a coupon of STIBOR 3m + 800 bps
and a 2 year SEK 0.4 fixed MTN with a coupon of 11.875%. The proceeds were
applied towards general corporate purposes, including refinancing of exist-
ing debt.

During 2023 commercial papers decreased by SEK 436 M. At the end of
the year, outstanding commercial papers amounted to SEK 694 M (1,130). The
decrease is due to generally lower liquidity in the commercial paper market.

Short- term provisions are expected to be settled within 12 months from of

determine in terms of their maturity and amount. Settlement is likely in one
year's time at the earliest, but not later than in 10 years' time.

Contract liability amounting to SEK 1,304 M represents revenue collected
in advance to service long-term NPLs portfolio. The Company has a right to
exclusively service these NPLs up to 2065. Revenue is recognised as services
are rendered. Significant revenue is expected to be recognised by 2030.


## Other current liabilities

For 2023 other current liabilities amount to SEK 1,507 M (1,967). Other current
liability includes an amount of SEK 98 M relating to the put/call options on
Spanish subsidiaries' non-controlling interest. The call option entitles Intrum
group to acquire and the put option entitles the counterparty to sell the
non-controlling interest at fair value to Intrum group. The options are exer-
cisable by either parties in 2023. The options have no pre-set expiry date and
are non-transferrable to third parties.

## Note 24 Share capital and reserves


### Share capital

According to the Articles of Association of Intrum AB (publ), the compa-
ny's share capital will amount to not less than SEK 1,300,000 and not more
than SEK 5,200,000. All shares are fully paid in, carry equal voting rights and
share equally in the company's assets and earnings. No shares are reserved
for transfer.

There are 121,720,918 shares in the company, and the share capital
amounts to SEK 2,899,805. See below regarding repurchased shares.


### Share repurchase

In 2021 140,000 shares were repurchased for SEK 0,44 M and 66,346 were
assigned to certain employees of the Group beneficiaries of the 2018 long
term incentive plan which vested in 2021. In 2022 further 320,000 shares
were repurchased for SEK 72 M and 59,671 were assigned to certain employ-
ees of the Group beneficiaries of the 2019 long term incentive plan which
vested in 2021. Accordingly, the number of shares outstanding at the
end of 2021 was 120,797,264 and at the end of 2022 and 2023 there were
120,536,935 shares. The average number of shares outstanding over the year
was 120,536,935 (120,636,616).


### Other shareholders' equity in the Group


#### Other paid-in capital

Refers to equity, other than share capital contributed by the owners or arising
owing to the Group's shared-based payment programs and also include the
share premiums paid in connection with the issuance of new issues.


### Reserves

Reserves includes the translation reserve, which contains all exchange
rate differences that have, since the transition to IFRS in 2004, arisen on
the translation of financial statements from foreign operations as well as
on long-term intra-Group receivables which are considered as permanent
investment in the Group's foreign operations. Reserves also include the
exchange rate gains and losses arising in the Parent Company's external loans
in foreign currency, which are intended to hedge the Group's translation
exposure attributable to net assets in foreign subsidiaries.


### Retained earnings including net earnings for the year

Refer to earnings in the Parent Company and subsidiaries, joint ventures and
associated companies. Provisions to the statutory reserve, excluding trans-
ferred share premium reserves, were previously included in this item. Accu-
mulated revaluations of the Group's defined benefit pension provisions are
also included. Dividends paid and share repurchases are deducted from the
amount.

Following the balance sheet date, the Board of Directors did not propose
dividend per share for the financial year ended December 31, 2023.

### Share premium reserve

When shares are issued at a premium, the amount exceeding their quota
value is transferred to the share premium reserve. Provisions to the share pre-
mium reserve as of 2006 are non-restricted equity.


### Fair value reserve

Refers to unrealised exchange rate gains or losses on external loans in for-
eign currency, which are intended to hedge the Group's translation expo-
sure attributable to net assets in foreign subsidiaries. The fair value reserve is
non-restricted equity.

Earnings brought forward

Refer to retained earnings from the previous year less the dividend paid and
share repurchases. Retained earnings are non-restricted equity.


### Capital structure

The company's definition of capital corresponds to shareholders' equity
including holdings without a controlling interest, which at year-end totaled
SEK 16,751 M (18,540).

The measure of the company's capital structure used for control purposes
is consolidated net debt in relation to pro forma rolling 12-month-adjusted
cash EBITDA, which at year-end amounted to 4.4x (4.0x). This ratio is calcu-
lated by placing current consolidated net debt at the end of the year in rela-
tion to pro forma cash EBITDA, including operations being phased out and
including a calculated cash EBITDA throughout the period for larger units
acquired during the year, and excluding non-recurring items (NRIs). Net debt
is defined as the sum of interest-bearing liabilities and pension provisions
less liquid funds and interest-bearing receivables.

The Board of Directors established in late 2020 a financial targets for the
Group, in which net debt divided by pro forma rolling 12-month-adjusted
cash EBITDA, as stated above, shall be between 2.5x and 3.5x in the long
term.


## Note 25 Non-controlling interest

The non-controlling interest relates to Greek and Spanish subsidiaries.
During the year, the Group acquired non-controlling interest in one of the
Spanish subsidiaries which resulted in reduction of the non-controlling bal-
ance by SEK 343 million. An equal amount was recognised as an increase
in shareholders equity balance. The cash payment for the share repur-
chase amounted to SEK 355 M and is included in the consolidated statement
of cash flows. The Group has a put/call option to acquire non-controlling
interest in a Spanish subsidiary. The put/call option on Spanish subsidi-
ary's non-controlling interest entitles either party to exercise the instrument,
requiring the Group to acquire minority stake at fair value. The instrument has
no pre-set expiry date and is non-transferrable to third parties.

### Pledged assets

Pledged collateral includes deposits and restricted bank balances that can
be claimed by clients, suppliers or authorities in the event that Intrum were
not to meet its contractual obligations. Pledged collateral also includes
shares in subsidiaries within the Group pledged as collateral for the Parent
Company's revolving credit facility. The reported value of pledged collat-
eral in the table above refers to the consolidated value of the subsidiaries' net
assets


### Payment guarantees

The Group offers services whereby clients, against payment, obtain a guar-
antee from Intrum regarding the clients' receivables from their customers.
This entails a risk being incurred that Intrum must compensate the customer
for the guaranteed amount in the event that the invoices are not paid on time.
In those cases where the guarantee comes into play, Intrum assumes the cli-
ent's claim against its customer and takes over the continued handling of the
case within the Portfolio Investments area of operations. At the end of the
year, the total amount of contingent liabilites is SEK 7 M (7). Intrum's risk in
this business is managed through strict credit limits and analyses of the bor-
rower's credit status. At the end of the year Intrum had allocated SEK 1 M (1) in
the balance sheet to cover payments that may arise due to the guarantee.


### Other

The Group is involved in several legal disputes, both disputes that are cus-
tomary for an organsation as Intrum and disputes in the ordinary course of
business. None of these disputes are expected to give rise to any signicant
liabilities or cost.

1\) Financial assets valued at amortized cost include portfolio investments,
other long-term receivables, accounts receivable, client funds, other cur-
rent receivables, accrued income, cash and cash equivalents and, for the
Parent Company, also intra-Group receivables.

2\) Financial assets and liabilities valued at fair value include derivative assets
and liabilities, deferred considerations related to acquisitions of shares
and other liabilities related to the acquisition of the minority interests in
certain Spanish and Greek subsidiaries. Derivatives are measured based
on valuation techniques that uses observable market data and thus fall
under Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy according to IFRS 13. Deferred
considerations and other liabilities are measured at fair value using non
observable market data and, therefore, fall under in accordance with level
3 in the valuation hierarchy according to IFRS 13.

3\) Financial liabilities valued at amortized cost include non-current and cur-
rent liabilities to credit institutions, bond loans, commercial papers, cli-
ent funds payable, accounts payable, advances from clients, other current
liabilities, accrued expenses and, for the Parent Company, intra-Group
liabilities.


### Financial risks and financial policies


#### Principles of financing and financial risk management

The financial risks that arise in Intrum's servicing operations are limited.
Thanks to a strong cash flow, combined with limited need for investment and
operating capital, external capital needs in the Group's service operations
are relatively low. The purchased debt operations have a greater need for
capital, particularly during a growth phase.

Intrum's financing and financial risks are managed within the Group in
accordance with the treasury policy established by the Board of Directors.
The treasury policy contains rules for managing financial activities, delegat-
ing responsibility, measuring and identifying financial risks and limiting these
risks.

Internal and external financial operations are concentrated in Group Trea-
sury in London, Stockholm and Oslo. This achieves economies of scale in
terms of pricing for financial transactions. Because Group Treasury can take
advantage of temporary surpluses and deficits in the Group's various coun-
tries of operation, the Group's total interest expense can be minimised.


### Market risk

Market risk consists of risks related to changes in exchange rates and interest
rate levels.


#### Exchange rate risk

Exchange rate risk is the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates will nega-
tively affect the Group's income statement, balance sheet and/or cash flows.
The most important currencies for the Intrum Group, other than the Swedish
krona (SEK), are the euro (EUR), the Swiss franc (CHF), the Hungarian forint
(HUF) and the Norwegian krone (NOK).

The following exchange rates have been used to translate transactions in
foreign currency in the financial accounts:


<table>
<tr>
<th colspan="3"></th>
<th>Average</th>

<td>0.0272</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NOK</td>
<td>0.99</td>
<td>1.06</td>
<td>1.01</td>
<td>1.05</td>
</tr>
</table>


Exchange rate risk can be divided into transaction exposure and transla-
tion exposure. Transaction exposure consists of net operating and finan-
cial receipts and disbursements in different currencies. Translation exposure
consists of the effects from the translation of the financial reports of foreign
subsidiaries and associated companies to SEK.


#### Transaction exposure

In each country, all income and most operating expenses are denominated
in local currencies, and thus currency fluctuations have only a limited impact
on the company's operating earnings in local currency. National opera-
tions seldom have receivables and liabilities in foreign currency. Income and
expenses in national currency are thereby hedged in a natural way, which lim-
its transaction exposure. The currency exposure that arises within the oper-
ating activities is limited to the extent it pertains to international collection
operations. The subsidiaries' projected flow exposure is not hedged at pres-
ent. All major known currency flows are hedged on a continuous basis in the
Group and the Parent Company through forward exchange contracts.


##### Translation exposure

Intrum operates in 21 countries. The results and financial position of subsid-
iaries are reported in the relevant foreign currencies and later translated into
SEK for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements. Consequently,
fluctuations in the SEK exchange rate affect consolidated income and earn-
ings, as well as equity and other items in the financial statements.

The Group's revenues are distributed by currency as follows:


<table>
<tr>
<th>SEKM</th>
<th>2023</th>
<th>2022</th>

<tr>

<td>526</td>
<td>527</td>

An appreciation of the Swedish krona of 10 percentage points on average in
2023 against EUR would thus, all else being equal, have affected revenues neg-
atively by SEK 1,391 M, against CHF by SEK 73 M, against HUF by SEK 114 M and
against NOK by SEK 133 M. In terms of net assets by currency, shareholders'
equity in the Group, including non-controlling interests, is distributed as follows:

All else being equal, an appreciation in the Swedish krona of 10 percentage points
as per 31 December 2023 against EUR would have affected shareholders' equity
in the Group negatively by SEK -186 M, negatively against CHF by SEK -48 M, neg-
atively against HUF by SEK-88 M and negatively against NOK by SEK -104 M.

The Group hedges part of its translation exposure by means of currency hedg-
ing measures, consisting of external loans in foreign currency and derivative
instruments. There is an economic relationship between the hedged balance
sheet items and the hedging instruments, in which the efficiency of the hedge is
tested and adjusted monthly. The effects of the translation exposure and hedg-
ing measures have opposite values (negative/positive) and are reported under
Other comprehensive income. The hedging instruments amounted to SEK
-27,026 M (-29,764) at year-end. No inefficiencies were reported during the year
regarding hedges of net investments in foreign operations.


##### Interest rate risks

Interest rate risks relate primarily to the Group's borrowings, which amounted
to SEK 59,852 M (56,519) on 31 December 2023. Intrum has a strong cash flow
which gives the Group the option of repaying loans or investing in portfolios.
65% of loans are fixed rate and 35% are floating rate. The Group's loans have a
fixed interest term - currently about 20 months (29) for the entire loan portfolio.

A 1-per cent increase in market interest rates during the year would have
adversely affected net financial items by approximately SEK 210 M. A five-per
cent increase would have adversely affected net financial items by SEK 1,052 M.


##### Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk of a loss or higher-than-expected costs to ensure the
Group's ability to fulfil its short and long-term payment obligations to outside
parties.

The Group's long-term financing risk is limited by committed loan facilities. The
Group's policy is that maximum 1/3 of the Group's total debt can mature in any 12
month rolling period.

In order to limit the Group's liquidity, Group Treasury shall, at least, have avail-
able liquidity, or credit lines available, to meet contractual and expected portfo-
lio investments for the coming 90 days. The Group has deposited its liquid assets
with established financial institutions where the risk of loss is considered remote.
The Group's finance function prepares regular liquidity forecasts with the pur-
pose of optimising the balance between loans and liquid funds so that the net
interest expense is minimised without, for that matter, incurring difficulties in
meeting external commitments.

Management have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a rea-
sonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in oper-
ational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus the financial statements have
been prepared on a going concern basis.

As of 31 December 2023, the Group has the current liabilities on commer-
cial papers and bond loans standing at SEK 7,953 M. The current liabilities slightly
increased as of Q1 2024 to SEK 7,984 M. In January 2024, the Group announced
SEK 11.5 BN asset sale to Cerberus with the expected net cash proceeds of SEK
8.2 BN. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2024.
The net cash proceeds from the sale to Cerberus can cover the liabilities that are
maturing within 12 months of the approval of the financial statements with remain-
ing headroom. In February 2024, the Group repurchased EUR 68.8 M of senior
notes maturing in 2025 and 2027 at a discounted amount of EUR 51.3M, creating a
capital gain of EUR 17.5 M. These two transactions reduce near and medium-term
leverage by SEK 8.9 BN and reduce interest expense over the next 12 months.

Further, management have conducted a stressed scenario liquidity assessment
taking into consideration cost inflation and increased financial expenses as well
as the minimum fixed cash inflows for the next 12 months. The result of the assess-
ment shows that the minimum cash liquidity available to the Group amounts to
SEK 30,195M, which is sufficient to cover the maximum cash outflows amount-
ing to SEK 26,901M. The stressed scenario shows that even without the proceeds
from the asset sale to Cerberus, Intrum will still be able to pay the outstanding cur-
rent liabilities on time. It is worth noting that this assessment ignores the beneficial
impact of the above-mentioned transactions but instead assumes 30% increased
finance expenses based on the current high interest rate environment and poten-
tial foreign exchange risks.

It is also noteworthy, that the underlying businesses for both servicing and
investing segments generates a positive cash inflow. As part of its proactive ini-
tiative to ensure long-term sustainable debt structure in line with the ongoing bal-
ance sheet management, the Group has appointed Houlihan Lokey and Milbank
as advisors that will include exploring refinancing and improving capital structure.

The table below provides an analysis of the financial liabilities of the Group
and the Parent Company broken down according to the amount of time remain-
ing until the contractual maturity date. The amounts given in the table are the con-
tractual, undiscounted cash flows.

## Credit risks

Credit risk consists of the risk that Intrum's counterparties are unable to fulfil
their obligations to the Group.

Financial assets that potentially subject the Group to credit risk include
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, portfolio investments, out-
lays on behalf of clients, derivatives and guarantees. For financial assets
owned by Intrum, no collateral or other credit reinforcements have been
received, with the exception of a certain portion of the Group's portfolio
investments. The maximum credit exposure for each class of financial assets
corresponds to the carrying amount.


### Cash and cash equivalents

The Group's cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank balances
and other short-term financial assets with a remaining maturity of less than
three months. The Group has deposited its liquid assets with established
banks where the risk of loss is considered remote.


### Accounts receivable

The Group's accounts receivable from clients and debtors in various indus-
tries, and are not concentrated in a specific geographical region. The Group's
largest client accounts for less than two% of revenues. Most accounts receiv-
able outstanding are with customers previously known to the Group and
whose creditworthiness is good. For an analysis of accounts receivable by
age, see Note 15.


### Portfolio investments

As part of its portfolio investment operations, Intrum acquires portfolios of con-
sumer receivables and tries to collect them. Unlike its conventional collection
operations where Intrum works on behalf of clients in return for commissions
and fees, in this case it assumes all the rights and risks associated with the receiv-
ables. The portfolios are purchased at prices significantly below their nominal
value, and Intrum retains the entire amount it collects, including interest and fees.
The acquired receivables are overdue and in many cases are from debtors who
are having payment problems. It is obvious, therefore, that the entire nominal
96
Annual and Sustainability Report 2023
About Intrum Strategy How we operate Governance and control Board of Directors' Report Financial statements Sustainability information

amount of the receivable will not be recovered. On the other hand, the receiv-
ables are acquired at prices significantly below their nominal value. The risk in
this business is that Intrum, at the time of acquisition, overestimates its ability to
collect the amounts or underestimates the costs of collection. The maximum
theoretical risk would be that the entire carrying value of SEK 35,423 M (37,109)
would become worthless and have to be written off. To minimise the risks in this
business, prudence is exercised in purchase decisions. The focus is on small and
medium-sized portfolios with relatively low average amounts, to help spread
risks. The average nominal principal value per case is approximately SEK 35,084.
Portfolios are normally acquired from customers with whom the Group has had
a long-term relationship. The acquisitions have generally consisted of unsecured
debt, requiring relatively less capital and significantly simplifying administra-
tion compared with collateralised receivables. Since 2016, however, Intrum has
also begun to acquire portfolios with underlying collateral, usually in the form of
property mortgages. Intrum places high yield requirements on the portfolios it
acquires. Before every acquisition, a careful assessment is made based on a pro-
jection of future cash flows (collected amount) from the portfolio. In these calcu-
lations Intrum benefits from its extensive experience in debt collection and from
the Group's scoring methods. Intrum therefore believes that it has the expertise
required to evaluate these types of receivables. To enable acquisitions of larger
portfolios at attractive risk levels, Intrum has, on occasion, partnered with other
companies such as Pireus Bank and Ibercaja Banco to share the capital invest-
ment and return. The currency risk is attributable to the translation of the balance
sheet item Portfolio investments is limited due to currency hedging using loans
in the same currency as the assets, and currency forwards. A considerable pro-
portion of the acquisitions take place through forward flow agreements - that is,
Intrum may have previously agreed with a company to acquire all of that compa-
ny's accounts receivable at a certain percentage of their nominal value once they
are overdue by a certain number of days. In most of these agreements, however,
Intrum has the opportunity to decline to acquire the receivables if, for example,
their quality decreases. Risks are diversified by acquiring receivables from clients
in different sectors and different countries. The Group's purchased debt portfo-
lios include debtors in 20 countries.

The Group's total carrying amount for purchased debt is distributed as
follows:

Receivables by country

· UK, 16% (13)

· Greece, 7% (7)

· Spain, 12% (11)

· Sweden, 7% (8)

· Norway, 10% (11)

· Hungary, 5% (5)

· Germany, 8% (9)

· Other countries, 35% (37)


## Receivables by industry

· Telecom companies, 5% (5)

· Bank sector, 65% (66)

· Credit card receivables, 12% (9)

· Other financial operations, 10% (11)

· Other segments, 9% (9)

Of the total carrying value on the balance sheet, 14% represents portfolio
acquisitions in 2023, 17% acquisitions in 2022, 14% acquisitions in 2021, 9%
acquisitions in 2020 and 10% acquisitions in 2019. The remaining 36% relates
to receivables acquired in or before 2018.


### Outlays on behalf of clients

As an element in its operations, the Group incurs outlays for court fees, legal
representation, enforcement authorities, etc., which can be charged to and
collected from debtors. In many cases Intrum has agreements with its clients
whereby any expenses that cannot be collected from debtors are instead
refunded by the client. The amount that is expected to be recovered from
a solvent counterparty is recognised as an asset in the balance sheet on the
line Other receivables.


### Derivative contracts

The credit risk in the Group's forward exchange contracts is limited because
the counterparty generally is a large bank or financial institution that is not
expected to become insolvent. On the balance sheet date, assets connected
to forward exchange contracts were valued at SEK 324 M (253), and liabilities
at SEK 303 M (138). The Group settles the derivative contracts on a net basis
with its counterparties.

The contracts have short maturities, typically one or more months. All
outstanding forward exchange contracts are restated at fair value in the
accounts, with adjustments recognised in the income statement. The pur-
pose of these forward exchange contracts has been to minimise exchange
rate differences in the Parent Company attributable to receivables and liabil-
ities in foreign currency.

Outstanding forward exchange contracts at year end in the Parent Com-
pany and in the Group comprise the following currencies:

### Payment guarantees

The Group offers services whereby clients, against payment, obtain a guaran-
tee from Intrum regarding the clients' receivables from their customers. This
entails a risk being incurred that Intrum must compensate the customer for
the guaranteed amount in the event that the invoices are not paid on time. In
those cases where the guarantee comes into play, Intrum assumes the client's
claim against its customer and takes over the continued handling of the case
within the Portfolio Investments area of operations. At the end of the year, the
total amount guaranteed was SEK 7 M (7). Intrum's risk in this business is man-
aged through strict credit limits and analyses of the borrower's credit status.


## Note 29 Related parties

All transactions with related parties are conducted on market terms and at
arm's length.

Related party transactions include transactions with the Board of Direc-
tors and senior executives, according to Note 32. The Group has long-term
servicing contracts with all joint ventures holding NPLs. The group recog-
nized servicing income from the JVs amounting to SEK 1,569 M (1,521), with
an outstanding receivable of SEK 82 M (214).

Although the Parent Company has close relationship to its subsidiaries,
see Note 34, it has no transactions with other related parties.

The Parent Company provides and receives services from and to its sub-
sidiaries. The Parent Company recognized income amounting to SEK 1,616M
(891) from provision of services and recognized expenses amounting to
SEK 842 M (692), with outstanding receivable of SEK 741 M (300) and out-
standing payable of SEK 28 M (48).


## Note 30 Subsequent events

On 22 January 2024, Intrum agreed to sell part of its portfolio investments
back-book to a third-party investor for a total consideration of SEK 9.6 BN.
The transaction will result in a total loss of SEK 845 M, which will be rec-
ognised in the Q1 2024 Consolidated Statement of Income.

The investments disposed of by Intrum will be acquired by a leveraged
investment vehicle. The acquired assets will be funded by 57% leverage and
27.95% by the third-party investor. The third-party investor and Intrum will
acquire a 65% and 35% stake in the leveraged investment vehicle, respec-
tively. Intrum will have a minimum 5-year exclusive servicing agreement with
the investment vehicle, provided certain KPIs are met. Intrum plans to use cash
proceeds from the back-book sale amounting to SEK 8.2 BN to reduce its debt.

## Note 32 Share-based payments

Beginning in 2018, certain key employees were granted performance shares
of Intrum AB, under the Group's Long Term Incentive Plans (the "LTIPs").
The beneficiaries of the plans are granted the right to receive ordinary
shares, without consideration, if certain financial targets set by the Board are
\- achieved over a specified three-year period except for the 2022 plan which
is linked to both Total Shareholer Return (TSR) targets and Cash Earnings per
Share (EPS).

Under the LTIPs, eligible employees may be granted up to certain percent-
\- age of their annual base salary ("offered amount"), worth of fully paid ordi-
nary shares of the Company for no cash consideration. The number of shares
assigned to the participants in the plans was the offer amount divided by the
weighted average price at which the Company's shares were traded on the
Stockholm Stock Exchange during the 20 days up to and including the date
of grant.

Plans are subject to performance conditions as well as service conditions.
\- The performance conditions used to assess the outcome of the LTIPs are dis-
\- tinctly linked to the business strategy and thereby to the Company's long-
term value creation.

The performance conditions used to assess the outcome of the LTIPs are
\- distinctly linked to the business strategy and thereby to the Company's long-
term value creation. These metrics are linked to the Company's Earnings Per
Share ("EPS") target established by the Board.

The 2021 plan was extended to not only include senior managers but
also other employees within the Group in order to maximize shareholders'
returns. Under the 2021 LTIPs, participants are granted performance shares
which only vest if certain Total Shareholder Return (TSR) targets, includ-
ing share price growth, dividends and capital return, are met over a period of
three years. Participant also were granted with restricted shares which are
only subject to service conditions.

The 2022 plan identifies three different group of employees who may
receive performance shares or cash if certain TSR (Series1 shares) or EPS tar-
gets (Series 2 shares) are met. There are no restricted shares granted.

The 2023 plan grants performance shares which are divided into two
series. Under 2023 LTIPs, participants are granted performance shares
(Series 1 shares) if certain TSR targets are met. In order to be entitled to per-
formance shares of Series 2, participants are required to allocate investment
shares to LTIP 2023 by making a personal investment in Intrum Shares. Some
participants may also receive cash-settled share-based payment if certain
TSR targets and service conditions are met.

The Group treasury acquires shares from the market to transfer shares to
employees on completion of vesting and performance conditions. Shares
held by the Group and not yet issued to employees at the end of the report-
ing period are shown as treasury shares in the financial statements.

As at 31 December 2023, following share awards remain outstanding:

The fair value of the Series 1 shares has been calculated to SEK 18,10 using a
Monte Carlo simulation with Geometric Brownian Motion given the follow-
ing assumptions:

· Share price at grant of SEK 53,27

· Volatility 41,80% (Expected volatility was determined by using annualized
daily return volatilities of Company shares 26 September 2020 - 15 May 2023)

· Risk free rate of return 2,73% (interpolation has been used when estimat-
ing the risk-free rate, as there is no exact match between interest rate
terms and the time period of the plan)

· Discounted future dividends 29,13

· Time horizon 3 years

The fair value of the Series 2 shares has been calculated to SEK 11,21 given the
following assumptions:

· Share price at grant of SEK 53,27

· Volatility 41,80%

· Risk free rate of return 2,73% (interpolation has been used when estimat-
ing the risk-free rate, as there is no exact match between interest rate
terms and the time period of the plan)

· Discounted future dividends 29,13

· Time horizon 3 years

The Group is responsible to withhold an amount equal to employees' tax obli-
gations associated with the share awards under local tax laws. The tax withheld
is paid to the respective tax authorities on behalf of the respective employees.

The performance shares granted under the LTIPs include a net settlement
feature under which the shares necessary to settle the employee's tax obliga-
tions are withheld.

The Group is settling the share grant on a net basis by withholding the
number of shares with a fair value equal to the monetary value of the employ-
ee's tax obligation and only granting the remaining shares on completion of
the vesting period.

The expense recognized for the plans at the end of 2023 is SEK 21,2 M, of
which SEK 13 M related to the 2021 plan, SEK 5,6 M related to the 2022 plan
and SEK 2,6 M is related to the 2023 plan.

In 2023, there are no treasury shares transferred to the participating
employees in line with the reversal of the 2020 LTIP plan as the EPS target
was not met at the end of 2022 .. There are also no accruals for cash-settled
share-based payment for LTIP 2023 at the as the TSR target is not likely to be
met for 2023 end of the reporting period.


## Note 33 Terms and conditions of employment for key executives


### The 2023 Annual General Meeting adopted the following guidelines for executive remuneration

The guidelines apply to the CEO and other members of Intrum's Group Man-
agement Team ("GMT"). The guidelines are forward-looking, i.e., they are
applicable to agreements on remuneration, and on amendments to remu-
neration already agreed, entered into after adoption of the guidelines by the
Annual General Meeting 2023. These guidelines do not apply to any remu-
neration to be separately resolved or approved by the General Meeting.


### The guidelines' promotion of the company's business strategy, long-term interests and sustainability

In short, Intrum's business strategy is to continue to grow, both in existing and
new markets, and to continue to build its position as the undisputed market
leader within the credit management industry. For more information regard-
ing the company's business strategy, visions and goals, please see www.
intrum.com.

A prerequisite for the successful implementation of the company's busi-
ness strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests, including its
sustainability, is that the company is able to recruit and retain qualified
employees. To this end, it is necessary that the company offers competitive
remuneration. These guidelines enable the company to offer members of the
GMT a competitive total remuneration.

Long-term share-related incentive programs ("LTIPs") have been imple-
mented in the company. Such LTIPs have been adopted by the Annual Gen-
eral Meeting and are therefore excluded from these guidelines. The LTIP
proposed by the Board to be adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2023
is excluded for the same reason, as well as similar programs to be adopted in
the future. The LTIPs includes the GMT and other key employees in the com-
pany. The evaluation metrics used to assess the outcome of the LTIPs are
distinctly linked to the business strategy and thereby to the company's long-
term value creation, including its sustainability.

Variable cash remuneration covered by these guidelines shall aim at pro-
moting the company's long-term business strategy and short-term interests,
including its sustainability.


### Forms of remuneration

Remuneration in the company should reflect job complexity, responsibil-
ity and performance, and it should be competitive in comparison with com-
parable companies within similar industries in the relevant geographies. The
remuneration shall consist of the following components: annual fixed cash
salary ("Base Salary"), annual variable cash remuneration, pension bene-
fits and other benefits. Additionally, the General Meeting may - irrespective
of these guidelines - resolve on, among other things, share-related or share
price-related remuneration such as LTIPs.


### Base Salary

The Base Salary is based on three cornerstones: job complexity & responsi-
bility, performance and local market conditions. The Base Salary is subject to
annual revision.


## Short-Term Incentive Program Intrum's Short-Term Incentive Program ("STIP") aims to drive, and is designed

to vary with, short-term business performance, and is set for one year at a
time. The evaluation metrics are individually decided for each member of
the GMT and consist primarily of []financial results (on group level or country
level/s, as applicable). Members of the GMT may also have a smaller portion
of targets linked to operational or non-financial metrics, such as Employee
Engagement Index. The Board may also decide to adjust the metric targets or
apply similar evaluation metrics if deemed appropriate.

The maximum STIP pay-out is 100% of the Base Salary for the CEO and the
CFO. For the other members of the GMT (except for the Chief Risk Officer,
who is not eligible for STIP) the normal maximum STIP pay-out is 35 to 70% of
the Base Salary.

To which extent the evaluation metrics for awarding STIP have been satis-
fied is evaluated and determined when the measurement period has ended.
The company's Remuneration Committee is responsible for preparing the
STIP evaluation for all GMT members. The determination of the STIP out-
come is then resolved by the Board in its entirety.

No deferral periods are applied in relation to STIP and the STIP agreement
does not contain any clause entitling the company to reclaim STIP.


### Extraordinary arrangements

Other one-off arrangements can be made on individual level in extraordinary
circumstances when deemed necessary and approved by the Board. The
purpose might be in relation to recruitments, retention of top talent needed
to secure successful implementation of the business strategy.
Any such arrangement needs to be capped at an amount equal to two (2)
times the individual's annual fixed salary.


### Pension benefits and other benefits

Intrum applies a retirement age of 65 for all members of the GMT, unless oth-
erwise follows from applicable national rules.

For the CEO, pension benefits, including health insurance (Sw: sjuk-
försäkring), shall be premium defined. STIP does not constitute pensionable
income. The pension premiums for premium defined pension shall amount to
not more than 35% of the Base Salary.

For other GMT members, pension benefits, including health insurance, shall
be premium defined unless the individual concerned is subject to defined ben-
efit pension under mandatory collective agreement provisions. Variable cash
remuneration shall qualify for pension benefits to the extent required by man-
datory collective agreement provisions. The pension premiums for premium
defined pension shall amount to not more than 30% of the Base Salary.

Other benefits than pension benefits may include, for example, life insur-
ance, medical insurance (Sw: sjukvårdsförsäkring), housing and com-
pany cars. For GMT members with housing benefits, such benefits may not
amount to more than 20% of the Base Salary. For GMT members without
housing benefits, such benefits may not amount to more than ten% of the
Base Salary.


### Termination of employment

The notice period may not exceed twelve months if notice of termina-
tion of employment is made by the company. Base Salary during the notice
period, severance pay and compensation during a non-compete period may
together not exceed an amount equivalent to twenty-four months Base Sal-
ary. The notice period may not exceed six months without any right to sever-
ance pay when termination is made by the GMT member.

Remuneration for non-compete undertakings shall compensate for loss of
income. The remuneration amounts to not more than 100% of the Base Sal-
ary at the time of termination of employment, unless otherwise provided by
99
Annual and Sustainability Report 2023
About Intrum Strategy How we operate Governance and control Board of Directors' Report Financial statements Sustainability information

mandatory collective agreement provisions, and shall be paid during the time
the non-compete undertaking applies, however not for more than twelve
months following termination of employment.

Remuneration and employment conditions for employees
In preparation of the Board's proposal for these guidelines and when evaluat-
ing whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable,
account has been taken regarding the remuneration and employment con-
ditions for employees of the company. This has been done by reviewing e.g.,
the employees' total remuneration, the components of their remuneration
and remuneration growth rate over time.

The decision-making process to determine, review and implement the guidelines
The Board has established a Remuneration Committee. The Remunera-
tion Committee's tasks include preparing the Board's decision to propose
these guidelines. The Board shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at
least every fourth year and submit it to the Annual General Meeting. The
guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the Annual
General Meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and eval-
uate programs for variable remuneration for the GMT, the application of the
guidelines for GMT as well as the current remuneration structures and com-
pensation levels in the company.

The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent of the
company and the GMT. The CEO and other members of the GMT do not par-
ticipate in the Board's processing of and resolutions regarding remunera-
tion-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.

Derogation from the guidelines

The Board may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines, in whole
or in part, if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a
derogation is necessary to serve the company's long-term interests, includ-
ing its sustainability, or to ensure the company's financial viability. As set out
above, the Remuneration Committee's tasks include preparing the Board's
resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to
derogate from the guidelines.

Description of material changes to the guidelines and how the views of
shareholders' have been taken into consideration

These guidelines do not entail any significant changes in relation to the com-
pany's existing guidelines apart from an increase of the maximum pay-out of
STIP for other GMT members from 50% to 70% of Base Salary.

The company has not received any views from shareholders to take into
consideration.

Information on remuneration resolved but not yet due and on derogations from
the remuneration guidelines resolved by the Annual General Meeting 2022
Previous Annual General Meetings have resolved on guidelines for executive
remuneration and other terms of employment for the period up until the next
Annual General Meeting. In short, these guidelines entail that Base Salary
and STIP shall be payable on conditions similar to what has been described
in these guidelines. Base Salary and STIP is expensed during the financial
year, and STIP is paid out after the year-end report has been adopted by the
Board.

The guidelines adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2022 have been
adhered to without derogation, and all previously approved remuneration
that has not yet been paid out is in line with the framework set out above.


## Terms of employment and remuneration of the CEO

Andrés Rubio had a level of remuneration during 2023 in accordance with
the Group's principles as detailed above. His fixed monthly salary as CEO
has been EUR 66,000. In addition to his fixed salary, he had the opportu-
nity to receive up to 100% of his annual salary within the framework of the
short-term incentive programme (STIP). The CEO participate in the Compa-
ny's Long-Term Incentive programme (LTIP) for 2023 in accordance with the
resolutions of the Annual General Meeting, with an allocation up to 230% of
annual salary at grant. He also had a company car and housing in accordance
with the Group's policies. The CEO is not entitled to any company spon-
sored pension plan. In the event of resignation by the employee, the period
of notice is six months and, in the event of termination by the company, the
period of notice is twelve months. In the event of termination, the Company
shall be entitled to relieve the CEO of the duties with immediate effect, how-
ever with unchanged benefits during the notice period and a severance pay
corresponding to 12 month's fixed salary.


## Terms of employment and remuneration for other members of Group Management

The remuneration and other terms of employment for other members of Group
Management which were approved following the 2023 Annual General Meet-
ing have followed the principles outlined above. This includes fixed annual salary
and the opportunity to receive 0-100% of annual salary within the framework of
the variable salary component. The Long-Term Incentive programme for 2023
was launched in May 2023 with allocation levels in accordance with the resolu-
tion of the Annual General Meeting, that is, 55-105% of fixed annual salary. Pen-
sion benefits vary from country to country. In several cases, they are included in
monthly salaries. All pension insurances plans are defined contribution plans,
except in cases where mandatory collective agreements apply, and the retire-
ment age is generally 65 years. Members of Group Management have company
cars, in accordance with the Group's car policy. Other benefits also occur, in
accordance with local practices, including subsidised meals and travel.

The notice of termination for members of Group Management Team varies
from three to 12 months, regardless of whether termination is initiated by the
employee or the Company.

LTIP 2021 partially vested at the end of 2023, and, in accordance with the
terms of the programme, shares were transferred to participants in March
2024. For Group Management (excluding the President and CEO), the allot-
ment in LTIP 2021 amounts to a total of 65,858 shares. The total number
of shares outstanding in LTIP 2022 and 2023 for the corresponding group
amounts to 307,313 shares.


## Remuneration for the year

Other senior executives in the table are defined as members of the GMT
other than the CEO, see the Corporate Governance Report. In 2023, seven
individuals was appointed and six stepped down. At the end of 2023, there
were 14 (15) other senior executives ..
