## **Translated Output:**#### 2 【History】<table><tr><td>Organizational History</td><td>Our company was founded in March 1960 in Minato-ku, Tokyo as "University Newspaper Advertising Company" (the predecessor of current Recruit Holdings Co., Ltd.) with the purpose of publishing recruitment advertisements from various companies in university newspapers. Later, we signed contracts to exclusively handle advertisements for multiple university newspapers and established the corporate entity University Advertising Co., Ltd. in October 1960. In 1962, we launched "Invitation to Companies." In April 1963, we changed the company name to Japan Recruitment Center Co., Ltd. In August of the same year, we established the current company as Japan Recruit Center Co., Ltd. (For subsequent organizational history, please refer to the timeline)</td></tr><tr><td>Business Expansion</td><td>Founded in 1960 as a specialized advertising agency for university newspapers. Two years later, we published "Invitation to Companies," a compilation of job information exclusively for university students, establishing the "Ribbon Model" business model connecting individual users and corporate clients. We expanded into mid-career recruitment, staffing, and other HR-related businesses, as well as life event areas such as education, housing, used cars, and marriage, and daily consumption areas like travel, dining, and beauty. In recent years, we have further expanded into business/management support services for SME clients including retailers and restaurants using SaaS (Software as a Service).</td></tr><tr><td>Digital Transformation of Information</td><td>Our company has consistently implemented computerization since its early days when computer adoption was still rare, pursuing speed and efficiency through digital transformation of information. After research on supercomputers in the 1980s, we transitioned from print media (information magazines) to internet and mobile platforms in the 1990s. Not only did we make information more accessible and faster to deliver, but we also developed innovative online reservation management systems, aiming to provide overwhelming convenience through digital transformation for both individual users and corporate clients, while accelerating the expansion of cloud-based SaaS solutions.</td></tr><tr><td>Globalization</td><td>Beginning in the 2000s, we promoted business expansion into global markets, initially launching wedding-related businesses in China but withdrawing after several years. However, this experience informed our subsequent overseas business strategy through M&A. After acquiring The CSI Companies, Inc.* in the U.S., we accelerated acquisitions in staffing services. While improving productivity of acquired organizations, we expanded operations worldwide including Europe and Australia. The acquisitions of Indeed, Inc.* in 2012 and Glassdoor LLC* in 2018 added HR Technology as a new business, driving growth for the entire group. Our services have now expanded to over 60 countries and regions.</td></tr><tr><td>Evolution as a Matching Platform</td><td>We have evolved from advertising-based media business into a marketplace business model that utilizes technology to provide more optimal matching solutions for both individual users and corporate clients. In HR Technology and staffing businesses, under the Simplify Hiring strategy, we aim to streamline recruitment processes and provide additional value to job seekers and employers. In Marketing Matching Technology business, under the Help Businesses Work Smarter strategy, we are building an ecosystem supporting business operations through matching platforms and SaaS, working to improve corporate clients' productivity and profitability. Additionally, by leveraging AI developed from our group's accumulated experience, we are focusing on further improving matching efficiency and speed.</td></tr></table>-5-
