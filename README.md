#### 2 [History]<table><tr><td>Organizational History</td><td>The Company was founded in March 1960 in Minato-ku, Tokyo, as "Daigaku Shimbun Advertising Agency," the predecessor of the current Recruit Holdings Co., Ltd., with the aim of publishing job advertisements from various companies in university newspapers. Subsequently, the company entered into contracts to handle advertisements for multiple university newspapers and, in October 1960, established a corporate entity, Daigaku Advertising Co., Ltd. In 1962, it launched "Invitation to Companies." In April 1963, the company name was changed to Japan Recruitment Center Co., Ltd. In August of the same year, the Company was established as Japan Recruit Center Co., Ltd. (For subsequent organizational history, please refer to the chronological table.)</td></tr><tr><td>Expansion of Business Domains</td><td>Founded in 1960 as an advertising agency specializing in university newspapers. Two years later, it published "Invitation to Companies," which collected only job information for university students, and established the "Ribbon Model," a business model connecting individual users and corporate clients. In addition to expanding into mid-career recruitment, personnel placement, and staffing businesses, the Company expanded into life event domains such as education, housing, used cars, and weddings, as well as daily consumption domains such as travel, dining, and beauty. In recent years, the Company has expanded its business domain to include business and management support services for small and medium-sized corporate clients, including retailers and restaurants, utilizing SaaS (Software as a Service).</td></tr><tr><td>Digitization of Information</td><td>The Company has been implementing computerization since a time when it was still uncommon, continuously promoting faster and more efficient operations through digitization of information. After research on supercomputers in the 1980s, in the 1990s, the Company shifted from print media (information magazines) to the Internet and then to mobile. Not only did this make information more accessible and faster to deliver, but the Company also developed innovative online reservation management systems, aiming to provide overwhelming convenience to individual users and corporate clients through digitization of information, and is accelerating the expansion of cloud-based SaaS solutions.</td></tr><tr><td>Globalization</td><td>Since the 2000s, the Company began expanding into global markets, initially launching a wedding-related business in China, but withdrew after a few years. However, this experience was leveraged in subsequent overseas business strategies through M&A, and after the acquisition of The CSI Companies, Inc.* in the U.S., the Company accelerated acquisitions in the staffing business. While working to improve the productivity of acquired organizations, the Company expanded its business to countries around the world, including Europe and Australia. The acquisitions of Indeed, Inc.* in 2012 and Glassdoor LLC* in 2018 added the HR Technology business, driving overall group growth. The Company’s services have now expanded to more than 60 countries and regions.</td></tr><tr><td>Evolution as a Matching Platform</td><td>The Company has evolved its advertising-based media business into a marketplace business model that leverages technology to provide more optimal matching solutions to both individual users and corporate clients. In the HR Technology and Staffing businesses, under the Simplify Hiring strategy, the Company aims to simplify the hiring process and provide greater value to job seekers and hiring companies. In the Marketing, Matching & Technology business, under the Help Businesses Work Smarter strategy, the Company is building an ecosystem that supports the business operations of corporate clients through matching platforms and SaaS, working to improve their productivity and profitability. In addition, by utilizing AI developed based on the experience accumulated by the Group, the Company is focusing on further improving the efficiency and speed of matching.</td></tr></table>- 5-
