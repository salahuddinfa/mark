## **Translated Text**#### 2 History<table><tr><td>History of Organization</td><td>The Company was founded in March 1960 in Minato-ku, Tokyo, with the goal of publishing recruitment advertisements for various companies in university newspapers. It was initially named "University Newspaper Advertising Company," the predecessor of Recruit Holdings Co., Ltd. Subsequently, in October 1960, the company concluded a contract to handle advertisements for multiple university newspapers and established University Advertising Co., Ltd. as a corporate organization in October 1960. In 1962, it launched "Invitation to Companies." In April 1963, the company changed its name to Japan Recruit Center Co., Ltd. In August of the same year, it established the Company as Japan Recruit Center Co., Ltd. (Please refer to the timeline for subsequent organizational changes.)</td></tr><tr><td>Expansion of Business Areas</td><td>The Company started as a specialized advertising agency for university newspapers in 1960. Two years later, it published "Invitation to Companies," which collected only job information for university students, establishing a business model called the "Ribbon Model" that connected individual users with corporate clients. In addition to expanding into human resources-related businesses such as mid-career recruitment, human resource introduction, and human resource dispatch, the Company also expanded into areas related to life events such as school advancement, housing, used cars, weddings, and into daily consumer areas such as travel, dining, and beauty. In recent years, it has expanded its business into services that support the operations and management of small and medium-sized enterprise clients, including retail and restaurant businesses, using SaaS (Software as a Service).</td></tr><tr><td>Digitalization of Information</td><td>The Company introduced computers at a time when their adoption was rare, and has continuously practiced and promoted the rapid and efficient processing of business through the digitalization of information. After conducting research on supercomputers in the 1980s, it shifted from paper-based media (information magazines) to the internet and mobile platforms in the 1990s. In addition to making information available more easily and quickly, it developed innovative online reservation management systems, among other initiatives, to provide overwhelming convenience through the digitalization of information to individual users and corporate clients. The Company has accelerated the expansion of its cloud-based SaaS solutions to provide greater convenience.</td></tr><tr><td>Globalization</td><td>The Company began to expand its business into the global market in the 2000s, initially by deploying its marriage-related business in China, although it withdrew a few years later. However, this experience contributed to its subsequent overseas business strategy through M&amp;A, and it accelerated acquisitions in the human resource dispatch business following its acquisition of The CSI Companies, Inc.* in the United States. While working to improve the productivity of the acquired organizations, it expanded its business into various countries around the world, including Europe and Australia. The acquisitions of Indeed, Inc.* in 2012 and Glassdoor LLC* in 2018 added a new HR technology business, driving the growth of the entire group. The Company's services are now available in over 60 countries and regions.</td></tr><tr><td>Evolution as a Matching Platform</td><td>The Company has evolved its advertising-based media business into a marketplace business model that provides more optimal matching solutions using technology for both individual users and corporate clients. In its HR technology business and human resource dispatch business, it aims to provide further value to job seekers and recruiting companies by simplifying the hiring process under the "Simplify Hiring" strategy. In its marketing, matching, and technology business, it aims to improve the productivity and profitability of corporate clients under the "Help Businesses Work Smarter" strategy by building an ecosystem that supports corporate operations with matching platforms and SaaS. The Company also focuses on further improving the efficiency and speed of matching by utilizing AI, which it has developed by leveraging its accumulated experience.</td></tr></table>-5-
