# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


## For the year ended 31 December 2023


## 1. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES


### Statement of compliance

PageGroup plc is a Company incorporated in the United
Kingdom under the Companies Act.

Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare
the Group and Parent Company financial statements in
accordance with UK-adopted international accounting
standards ("IFRSs").


### Basis of preparation

The financial statements of PageGroup plc consolidate the
results of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006,
the profit and loss account of the Company has not
been included as part of these financial statements. The
Company's profit for the financial year amounted to £98.0m
(2022: £150.8m).

The Group's consolidated financial statements have been
prepared on an accruals basis and under the historical cost
convention, except for the revaluation of derivatives. The
Group's financials are presented in Sterling and all values
are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (£'000) except
when otherwise indicated.


### Basis of consolidation


#### (i) Subsidiaries

The consolidated financial statements comprise the
financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries
as at 31 December 2023. Control is achieved when the
Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its
involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect
those returns through its power over the investee.


### (ii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation

Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or
income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions,
are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial
statements. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same
way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is
no evidence of impairment.


### (iii) Employee Benefit Trust

Shares in PageGroup plc held by the trust are shown as a
reduction in Shareholders' funds.


### (iv) Changes in accounting policy - new accounting standards, interpretations and amendments

The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those
of the previous financial years except for the following
amendments to IFRS effective as of 1 January 2023:

. Amendments to IAS 12: Deferred Tax related to Assets
and Liabilities arising from a single transaction

· Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practices Statement 2 -
Disclosure of accounting policies

The adoption of these accounting standards or
interpretations did not have any impact on the accounting
policies, financial position or performance of the Group.

. IAS 12 International Tax Reform: Pillar Two Model Rules

On 19 July 2023, the UK Endorsement Board adopted the
Amendments to IAS 12 International Tax Reform: Pillar Two
Model Rules, issued by the IASB in May 2023. PageGroup
has applied the mandatory temporary exception to the
accounting for deferred taxes arising from the jurisdictional
implementation of the Pillar Two model rules. Further details
are included at note 7.


### Standards issued but not yet effective

The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet
effective, up to the date of issuance of the Group's financial
statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt
these standards, if applicable, when they become effective.

· Amendments to IAS 1: Classification of Liabilities as
Current or Non-current; effective date 1 January 2024

. Amendments to IAS 1: Non-current liabilities with
Covenants; effective date 1 January 2024

The amendments are not expected to have a material impact
on the Group.


### Going concern

The Board has undertaken a review of the Group's forecasts
and associated risks and sensitivities, in the period from the
date of approval of the financial statements to March 2025
(review period).

The Board considered a variety of downsides that the Group
might experience, such as a global downturn, a cyber-attack
resulting in significant reputational damage and loss of clients
and candidates, and the Group's business model becoming
ineffective due to new innovations such as recruitment via
social media. All modelled scenarios would be expected to
impact gross profit and headcount, impacting conversion.

The Group had £90.1m of cash as at 31 December 2023,
with no debt except for IFRS 16 lease liabilities of £110.9m.
Debt facilities relevant to the review period comprise a
committed £80m RCF maturing December 2027, an
uncommitted UK trade debtor discounting facility (up to
£50m depending on debtor levels) and an uncommitted
£20m UK bank overdraft facility. Under these latest forecasts,
the Group is able to operate without the need to draw on its
available facilities. The forecast cash flows indicate that the
Group will comply with all relevant banking covenants during
the review period.

Despite the macroeconomic and political uncertainty that
currently exists, and its inherent risk and impact on the
business, based on the analysis performed there are no
plausible downside scenarios that the Board believes would
cause a liquidity issue.

Given the Group's resilient performance in 2023, the level of
cash in the business and the Group's borrowing facilities, the
geographical and discipline diversification, limited Customer
concentration risk, as well as the ability to manage the cost
base, the Board has concluded that the Group has adequate
resources to continue in operation, meet its liabilities as they
fall due, retain sufficient available cash and not breach the
covenants under the RCF for the foreseeable future, being
a period of at least 12 months from the date of the approval
of the financial statements. The Board therefore considers it
appropriate for the Group to adopt the going concern basis
in preparing its financial statements.

### a) Revenue and income recognition

Revenue, which excludes value added tax (VAT), constitutes
the value of services undertaken by the Group from its principal
activities, which are recruitment consultancy and other ancillary
services. These consist of:

. revenue from temporary placements, which represents
amounts billed for the services of temporary staff,
including the salary cost of these staff. This is recognised
when the service has been provided;

. revenue from permanent placements is typically based on
a percentage of the candidate's remuneration package
and is derived from both retained assignments (income
recognised on completion of defined stages of work)
and non-retained assignments (income recognised at
the date an offer is accepted by a candidate and where
a start date has been determined). The latter includes
revenue anticipated, but not invoiced, at the balance
sheet date, which is correspondingly accrued on the
balance sheet within accrued income. A provision is made
against accrued income for possible cancellations of
placements prior to, or shortly after, the commencement
of employment; and

. revenue from amounts billed to clients for expenses
incurred on their behalf (principally advertisements) is
recognised when the expense is incurred.

The present value of revenue recognised is equal to the cash
funds receivable as invoices are settled within a year of initial
recognition. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by
reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective
interest rate applicable.


### b) Cost of sales

Cost of sales consists of the salary cost of temporary staff and
costs incurred on behalf of clients, principally advertising costs.


### c) Gross profit

Gross profit represents revenue less cost of sales and consists
of the total placement fees of permanent candidates, the
margin earned on the placement of temporary candidates and
the margin on advertising income.


### d) Foreign currency translation

(i) Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements of each of the
Group's entities are measured using the currency of the
primary economic environment in which the entity operates
("the functional currency"). The consolidated financial
statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Company's
functional and presentation currency.


#### (ii) Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective
functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the
dates of the transactions.

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at
year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the
income statement.


#### (iii) Group companies

The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none
of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy)
that have a functional currency different from the presentation

currency are translated into the presentation currency as
follows:

· assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are
translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance
sheet;

. income and expenses for each income statement are
translated at average exchange rates; and

. all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other
comprehensive income.


### e) Intangible assets


#### (i) Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition
over the fair value of the Group's share of the net identifiable
assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries is included
in intangible assets. Goodwill is stated at cost less any
accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-
generating units and is not amortised, but is tested at least
annually for impairment (see accounting policy h). Gains and
losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount
of goodwill relating to the entity sold.


#### (ii) Computer software

Computer software acquired separately is measured on
initial recognition at cost. Computer software developed
by the Group is measured at the cost incurred in relation
to the development of software and related applications.
Costs are capitalised when they fulfil the criteria in IAS 38
regarding internally developed intangible assets. The Group
applies judgement, which is not considered as significant,
in capitalising the development cost by assessing if it will
generate probable future economic benefits. Costs which
are incurred after the release of software or costs which are
incurred in order to enhance existing products are expensed in
the period in which they are incurred.

(iii) Software under construction

Software under construction relates to cost capitalised in relation
to the development of a new operating system and related
applications. Costs are capitalised when they fulfil the criteria
in IAS 38 regarding internally developed intangible assets.
While still under construction, assets are tested for impairment
annually. Assets are moved from software under construction to
computer software when they become available for use.


#### (iv) Trademark

Acquired trademarks are stated at cost and are written down
over five years on a straight-line basis, which represents the
estimated useful life of the intangible asset.


#### (v) Amortisation

Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-
line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets
unless such lives are indefinite. Goodwill has an indefinite
useful life. Computer software is amortised at 20% per annum
unless it is considered to have a shorter life, in which case the
period of amortisation is reduced. The cumulative amount of
goodwill written off directly to retained earnings in respect of
acquisitions prior to 31 December 1997 is £311.7m (2022:
£311.7m).


### f) Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at original cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated to write
off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset evenly

over its expected useful life at the following rates:

. Leasehold improvements 10% per annum or period of
lease if shorter

· Furniture, fixtures and equipment 10-20% per annum

· Motor vehicles 25% per annum


### g) Investments

Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for
impairment.


#### h) Impairment of assets


##### (i) Non-financial assets

Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to
amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. An
impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the
asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.

The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair
value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes
of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest
levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows
(cash-generating units).

(ii) Financial assets

The Company and Group recognise an allowance for
expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not
held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on
the difference between the contractual cash flows due in
accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the
Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of
the original effective interest rate.

ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures
for which there has not been a significant increase in credit
risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit
losses that result from default events that are possible within
the next 12 months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit
exposures for which there has been a significant increase
in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is
required for credit losses expected over the remaining life
of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a
lifetime ECL).

For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies
a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the
Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead
recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each
reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix
that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted
for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the
economic environment as well as potential cancellations.


## i) Taxation

Income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax
and deferred tax charges. The tax currently payable is based
on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit
as reported in the income statement because it excludes
items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible
in other years and it further excludes items that are never
taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current tax
is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the
computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the
balance sheet liability method.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be
available against which deductible temporary differences can
be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if
the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the
initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of
other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither
the taxable profit nor the accounting profit or that did not give
rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The
carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected
to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset
realised.

Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement,
except when it relates to items charged or credited directly
to OCI or equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt
with in OCI or equity.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a
legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes
levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

IAS 12 has been amended to add the exception to
recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax
assets and liabilities that are related to tax law enacted or
substantively enacted to implement the Pillar Two model
rules published by the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (the "Pillar Two legislation"). The
amendments require that entities shall disclose separately
its current tax expense/ income related to Pillar Two income
taxes, and the qualitative and quantitative information
about its exposure to Pillar Two income taxes. The Group
will disclose known or reasonably estimable information
that helps users of financial statements to understand the
Group's exposure to Pillar Two income taxes.


## j) Pension costs

The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those
of the Group in independently administered funds. The
pension costs charged to the income statement represent
the contributions payable by the Group to the funds during
each period.


## k) Leases


### (i) Right-of-use assets

The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the
commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying
asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured
at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment
losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease
liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount
of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred,
and lease payments made at or before the commencement
date less any lease incentives received. Unless the Group is
reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at
the end of the lease term, the recognised right-of-use assets

---

are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its
estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets
are subject to impairment.


### (ii) Lease liabilities

At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises
lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease
payments to be made over the lease term.

The lease payments include fixed payments (including
in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives
receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or
a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value
guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise
price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised
by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a
lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option
to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend
on an index or a rate are recognised as expense in the period
on which the event or condition that triggers the payment
occurs.

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the
Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease
commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is
not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the
amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of
interest and reduced for the lease payments made.

In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is
remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease
term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a
change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.


#### (iii) Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets

The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption
to its short-term leases of machinery and equipment (i.e.
those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from
the commencement date and do not contain a purchase
option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition
exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered
of low value (i.e. below £5,000). Lease payments on short-
term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

iv) Judgement in determining the lease term of contracts with
renewal options

The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable
term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an
option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be
exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate
the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.

The Group has the option, under some of its leases to lease
the assets for additional terms of three to ten years. The Group
applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain
to exercise the option to renew. That is, it considers all relevant
factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the
renewal. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses
the lease term if there is a significant event or change in
circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to
exercise (or not to exercise) the option to renew (e.g. a change
in business strategy).


## l) Segment reporting

IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the
basis of internal reports about components of the Group that
are regularly reviewed by the Board to allocate resources to
the segments and to assess their performance. Information
provided to the Board is focused on regions and as a result,

reportable segments are on a regional basis. Transactions
between segments are recorded and allocated on an arms-
length basis.


## m) Dividend distribution

Dividend distribution to the Company's Shareholders is
recognised as a liability in the Group's financial statements in
the period in which the dividends are approved by (for final
dividends) or paid to (for interim dividends) the Company's
Shareholders.


## n) Share-based compensation

The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based
compensation plans. The accounting treatments for the Group
and Parent Company are described below:


### (i) Share option schemes

The fair value of the employee services received in exchange
for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense in
the income statement of the Group with a corresponding
adjustment to equity. In the parent company, it is capitalised
as an investment, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period
is determined by reference to the fair value of the options
granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting
conditions (for example, earnings per share). Non-market
vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the
number of options that are expected to become exercisable.

At each balance sheet date, the estimate of the number
of options that are expected to become exercisable is
revised. The Group recognises the impact of the revision of
original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and the
corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting
period.

(ii) Management Incentive Plan

Where deferred awards are made to Directors and senior
executives under the Management Incentive Plan, to reflect
that the awards are for services over a longer period, the value
of the expected award is charged to the income statement
of the Group on a straight-line basis over the vesting period
to which the award relates. In the Parent Company, it is
capitalised as an investment in the subsidiary that is receiving
the employee service, with a corresponding adjustment to
equity.


#### (iii) Employee Single Incentive Plan (ESIP)

Awards under the ESIP are paid in cash (40%) and Shares
(60%), which vest in three tranches over a three-year period.
The value of expected award is charged to the income
statement of the Group relative to these vesting periods.


#### (iv) Tax on share schemes

Where options or shares are net settled in respect of
withholding tax obligations, these are accounted for as
equity settled transactions. Payments to local tax authorities
are accounted for as a deduction from equity for the shares
withheld.


## o) Deferred cash bonus

The Group operates a bonus scheme for some members of
staff whereby bonuses are deferred for three years from date
of award. The bonuses are paid in full if the employee remains
employed for the entire three-year period.


## p) Repurchase of share capital

When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased,
the amount of the consideration paid, including any directly

attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity.


## q) Provisions

A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the
Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a
result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors' best estimate
of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the
balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value
where the effect is material.


## r) Pension liabilities

The Group has an unfunded retirement indemnity plan
relating to a pension scheme in France. At 31 December
2023, the Group's commitment was £2.3m (2022: £0.6m)
with the movement due to changes in actuarial assumptions
recognised in other comprehensive income.

There are some further statutory schemes in other territories
not recognised in the financial statements, which are
immaterial individually and in aggregate.


## s) Financial assets and liabilities

Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, and
subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through
other comprehensive income (OCI), and fair value through
profit or loss.

The classification of financial assets at initial recognition
depends on the financial assets' contractual cash flow
characteristics and the Group's business model for
managing them. With the exception of trade receivables that
do not contain a significant financing component or for which
the Group has applied the practical expedient, the Group
initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the
case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or
loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain
a significant financing component or for which the Group
has applied the practical expedient are measured at the
transaction price determined under IFRS 15.

The Group's financial assets at amortised cost include
trade and other receivables. In order for a financial asset to
be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value
through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are
"solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)" on the
principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to
as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level.

The Group's business model for managing financial assets
refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to
generate cash flows. The business model determines
whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual
cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both.

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash-in-hand, deposits
held at call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an
integral part of the Group's cash management are included
as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the
purpose of the statement of cash flows. Prepayments and
accrued income are held at amortised cost.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and,
in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of
directly attributable transaction costs.

The Group's financial liabilities include trade and other
payables and derivative financial instruments.

Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition,
as financial liabilities through profit or loss, loans and
borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as
hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.
The Group has derivative contracts at the balance sheet
date that have been valued at fair value through the income
statement.


## t) Areas of accounting estimation

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
IFRSs requires the use of certain accounting estimates
and judgements. It also requires management to exercise
judgement in the process of applying the Company's
accounting policies.

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are
based on historical experience and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances.

In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements
management has considered the impact of climate change,
particularly in the context of the risks identified in the TCFD
disclosures on pages 52 to 57 this year and the stated Net
Zero targets. These considerations did not have a material
impact on the financial reporting judgements and estimates.
In particular, management has considered the impact of
climate change in respect of the following areas:

. the Group's going concern assessment to March 2025
and viability of the Group over the next three years;

. cash flow forecasts used in the impairment assessment
of non-current assets including goodwill; and

· carrying value and useful economic lives of plant,
property and equipment and intangibles.

Whilst there is no medium-term impact expected from
climate change, management is aware of the ever-evolving
risks associated with climate change and will continue to
monitor these and their impact on the judgements and
estimates made in the Group's Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The following are areas where appropriate accounting
necessarily involves management judgement and estimation.
However, none of the estimates described are considered to
have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to
the carrying amount of the related assets and liabilities within
the next financial year. Accordingly, they are not considered
to be major sources of estimation uncertainty.


### (i) Trade and other receivables

There is uncertainty regarding Customers who may not be
able to pay as their invoices fall due as at 31 December
2023. In total the Group holds £281.7m of Gross Trade
Receivables (2022: £320.8m). A provision for £11.1m (2022:
£13.0m) has been recognised based on the expected credit
losses, cancellations or balances which are in litigation.

In reviewing the appropriateness of the provisions in respect
of recoverability of trade receivables, consideration has been
given to the economic climate in the respective markets, the
ageing of the debt and the potential likelihood of default. If
the economic climate was to deteriorate across a number
of countries the portfolio could be impaired by an amount
greater than materiality. This scenario is however considered
sufficiently remote such that no reasonably possible changes
in assumptions are likely to cause material further impairment
next year. Please see note 22 for an analysis of expected
credit losses and cancellations.

#### (ii) Deferred Tax

At 31 December 2023, PageGroup's deferred tax assets are
£19.9m (2022: £18.6m). The ultimate realisation of deferred
tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
taxable income during the periods in which those temporary
differences become deductible or in which tax losses can be
utilised. The tax effect of deductible temporary differences
and unused tax losses are recognised as a deferred tax asset
when it becomes probable that the tax losses and deductible
temporary differences will be utilised. In making assessments
regarding deferred tax assets, management considers the
scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future
taxable income, the availability to carry back losses and tax
planning strategies.

At 31 December 2023, based upon the projections for future
taxable income over the periods in which deferred tax assets
are deductible, management believes that it is more likely than
not that PageGroup will realise the benefits of these deductible
differences. The amount of deferred tax assets considered
realisable could however be reduced in subsequent years if
estimates of future taxable income during their carry forward
periods are reduced, or rulings by the tax authorities are
unfavourable. Estimates are therefore subject to change due to
both market-related and government-related uncertainties, as
well as PageGroup's own future decisions.


### (iii) Uncertain tax positions

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income
for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted
at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable

in respect of previous years.

Uncertain tax positions are assessed and measured on an
issue by issue basis within the jurisdictions that we operate
using management's estimate of the most likely outcome.
Where management determines that a greater than 50%
probability exists that the tax authorities would accept the
position taken in the tax return, amounts are recognised in the
consolidated financial statements on that basis. Where the
amount of tax payable or recoverable is uncertain, the Group
recognises a liability or asset based on either: management's
judgement of the most likely outcome; or, when there is a wide
range of possible outcomes, a probability weighted average
approach. The Group recognises interest on late paid taxes
as part of financing costs. The Group recognises penalties, if
applicable, as part of administrative and other expenses.

These estimates include management judgements about the
probable outcome of uncertain tax positions. Management
base their judgements on the latest information available about
the positions expected to be taken by each tax authority.
Actual outcomes and settlements may differ from the estimates
recorded in these consolidated financial statements however
we do not anticipate a significant risk of resulting in a material
adjustment. The uncertain tax position provision recognised as
at 31 December 2023 is £3.3m (2022: £3.0m).


## u) Employee Benefit Trust

The Employee Benefit Trust is considered a separate legal
entity and not an extension of the Parent Company. It is
included in the consolidated results of the Group as it is
deemed to have control of the entity.


## 2. SEGMENT REPORTING

All revenues disclosed are derived from external Customers.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group's accounting policies described in Note 1. Segment
operating profit represents the profit earned by each segment including allocation of central administration costs. This is the
measure reported to the Group's Board, the chief operating decision maker, for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment
of segment performance. Segments are aggregated in accordance with management ownership, determined by the possession of
similar characteristics such as geography, market maturity and economic environment. No judgements were applied to identify the
reportable segments.

The above analysis by destination is not materially different to the analysis by origin.


The analysis below is of the carrying amount of reportable segment assets, liabilities and non-current assets. Segment assets
and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

The individual reportable segments exclude income tax assets and liabilities. Non-current assets include property, plant and
equipment, computer software, goodwill and other intangibles.

We have generated profits in overseas countries which have higher tax rates and are subject to additional taxes on profits which
have contributed 5.6% to the tax rate in 2023. Disallowable and other permanent differences are broadly in line with prior years and
contributed 2.4% to the tax rate in 2023. Net derecognition of overseas losses and other tax attributes, that we could not recognise
due to the requirement to have profits against which to offset in the foreseeable future, increase the rate by 2.3%. Adjustments in
respect of prior periods are one-off in nature and had a negligible impact. These combine to add to the basic UK rate of 23.5% to
give the total effective tax rate of 34.4%.

The UK corporation tax rate increased to 25% (from 19%) on 1 April 2023. This was previously enacted in 2021 and UK deferred
taxes at balance sheet dates have been measured using these enacted tax rates and reflected in these financial statements.


## 7. CURRENT TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

The current tax asset of £23.4m (2022: £17.2m), and current tax liability of £6.0m (2022: £18.1m) for the Group, and current tax
asset and liability of Enil (2022: Enil) for the Parent Company, represent the amount of income taxes recoverable and payable in
respect of current and prior periods.

Pillar Two legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted in certain jurisdictions in which the Group operates, including
the UK. The legislation will be effective for the Group's financial year beginning 1 January 2024. The Group is in scope of the
Pillar Two legislation and has performed an assessment of the Group's potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes. The
assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes is based on the most recent country-by-country reporting
prepared for the Group and management is not currently aware of any circumstances under which this might change. Based on
this assessment, the Group does not expect any material potential exposure to Pillar Two top-up taxes.

The proposed final dividend had not been approved by the Board at 31 December 2023 and therefore has not been included as
a liability. The proposed final dividend of 11.24p (2022: 10.76p) per ordinary share will be paid on 21 June 2024 to Shareholders
on the register at close of business on 17 May 2024.


## 9. EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE

<td>Basic earnings per share</td>
<td>24.4</td>
<td>43.7</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
</table>


The above results relate to continuing operations.


### Basic

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding unallocated ordinary shares purchased by the Employee
Benefit Trust and held in the reserve.


### Diluted

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. This calculation determines the number of shares that could have been
acquired at fair value (determined as the average market price of the Company's shares) based on the monetary value of the
subscription rights attached to the outstanding share options. The number of shares calculated in the basic earnings per share
is then adjusted to reflect the number of shares deemed to be issued for nil consideration as a result of the potential exercise of
existing share options. The remaining share options that are currently not dilutive and hence excluded from the dilutive earnings
per share calculation remain potentially dilutive until they are either exercised or they lapse.

# IMPAIRMENT TESTS FOR GOODWILL

Goodwill is allocated to the Group's cash-generating units (CGUs) identified according to the country of operation. A summary of
the goodwill allocation is presented below:


<table>
<tr>
<th rowspan="2"></th>
<th>2023</th>
<th>2022</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>000.3</th>
<th>£'000</th>

<td>1,274</td>

In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are calculated by preparing cash flow forecasts derived from the
most recent financial budget, management projections for five years, followed by an assumed growth rate of 0% (2022: 0%),
which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the relevant markets and reflects long-term wage inflation fee
growth. Management applied a discount rate of 8% (2022: 8%), representing the weighted average cost of capital for the Group,
to the estimated future cash flows to calculate the terminal value of those cash flows. If the recoverable amount of an asset
is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. An
impairment loss is recognised as an expense. Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key
assumptions would cause the carrying value of goodwill allocated to any CGU to materially exceed its recoverable amount.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. It is

## Dilapidation

A provision has been recognised for dilapidation costs associated with our office portfolio, where the Group is committed to make good on
the property sites on lease termination.


## Social security contributions on share options

The provision for social security contributions on share options is calculated based on the number of options outstanding at the reporting
date that are expected to be exercised. The provision is based on market price of the shares at the reporting date which is the best
estimate of the market price at the date of exercise. It is expected that the costs will be incurred during the exercise period of 1 January
2024 to 31 December 2024.


# 17. GROUP BORROWING FACILITIES

At 31 December 2023, the Group had an available £80m committed RCF facility maturing 9 December 2027, uncommitted bank overdraft
facilities of £21m (2022: £21m), and an uncommitted £50m invoice discounting arrangement with HSBC Limited based on the carrying
amount of UK trade receivables of £30.5m (2022: £22.4m). None of the facilities were drawn at year end (2022: Enil).

All uncommitted facilities are repayable on demand. The Group's exposure to interest rate, foreign currency and liquidity risk for financial
assets and liabilities is disclosed in Note 22.


# 18. DEFERRED TAX

Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where permissible in accordance with the Group's accounting policy.

The temporary differences shown under "Other" of (£0.1m) (2022: £0.7m) predominantly includes such differences in relation to
fixed assets (£2.6m) (2022: £0.8m), differences between the Group GAAP, IFRS, and the local GAAP of each country in which
PageGroup operates and differences between recognition of income and expense for accounting and tax purposes and other
items of (£1.1m) (2022: £3.4m), IFRS 16 of £1.3m (2022: £1.1m) and other items of £2.3m (2022: £2.2m). The realisation of the
deferred tax asset in respect of losses is dependent upon generating future taxable profits in the territories in which the deferred
tax assets have arisen.

The recognition of deferred income tax assets is supported by management's forecasts of future profitability of the relevant
countries. Management consider these forecasts are sufficiently reliable to support recovery of these assets. Where the
forecasts of future profits are insufficient to support recovery, no deferred income tax assets have been recognised.

The net deferred tax asset of £17.5m (2022: £17.3m) includes £5.8m of deferred tax assets in relation to entities that have
incurred an accounting loss in either 2023 and 2022. In line with the most recent budgets which forecast profits for these
entities, management expects these losses to be substantially recovered within three years.

At 31 December 2023, £41.3m (2022: £40.8m) of deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and tax credits have
not been recognised due to uncertainty over the taxable profits available to support the realisation of these attributes. The tax
effected balances are £12.8m (2022: £12.3m).

The balance includes gross unrecognised tax losses of £29.0m (2022: £26.8m) of which £23.5m have no expiry, £1.6m that will
expire at various dates to 31 December 2028 with the remainder of £3.9m expiring at various dates to 31 December 2034. The
single most material country which has unrecognised tax losses is Brazil with £21m (2022: £16m).

The Group's overseas subsidiaries have net unremitted earnings of £161.8m (2022: £188.7m), resulting in temporary differences
of £27.1m.(2022: £33.9m). No deferred tax has been provided in respect of these differences since the timing of the reversals
can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

## Note 1


### Share Option Scheme

Executive Directors of the Company are not eligible to participate in this plan. Any exercises of awards made under this plan are
settled by shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust.

This share option scheme was created in 2009 to provide an effective plan under which to grant awards from 2009 onwards. It was
the Board's view that grants made under the existing ESOS, which would have required an increase over the 2008 base earnings per
share of at least 3% per annum above the growth in the UK Retail Price Index by 2011, would not be achievable due to the impact
of the global downturn on the Group's EPS and thus would not provide the required retention incentive. Further grants under the
SOS have been made in each year from 2011. The performance conditions for these grants are also linked directly to the Group's
Operating Profit.

For grants between 2012 and 2015, if Operating Profit is in excess of £50m, a proportion of the award equivalent to the amount
of Operating Profit achieved will vest up to a maximum of 100% if the Operating Profit is £100m or more. As Operating Profit of
£118.3m was achieved in 2017, the performance criteria have been fully achieved and these awards have fully vested.

For the 2016 grant, if Operating Profit is in excess of £75m, 2% of the award will vest for every additional £1m of Operating Profit
achieved, up to a maximum of 100% at Operating Profit of £125m or more. As Operating Profit of £142.5m was achieved in 2018,
the performance criteria have been fully achieved and these awards have fully vested.

For the 2017 grant, if Operating Profit is in excess of £50m, 25% of the award will vest, 1% of the award will vest for every additional
£1m of Operating Profit achieved, up to a maximum of 100% at Operating Profit of £125m or more. As Operating Profit of £146.7m
was achieved in 2019, the performance criteria have been fully achieved and these awards have fully vested.

For the 2018 grant, if Operating Profit is in excess of £75m, 25% of the award will vest. 1% of the award will vest for every
additional £1m of Operating Profit achieved, up to a maximum of 100% at Operating Profit of £150m or more. As Operating
Profit of £168.5m was achieved in 2021, the performance criteria have been fully achieved and these awards have fully vested.

For the 2019 grant, if Operating Profit is in excess of £100m, 1% of the award will vest for every additional £1m of Operating
Profit achieved, up to a maximum of 100% at Operating Profit of £200m or more. As Operating Profit of £196.1m was achieved
in 2022, 96% of the performance criteria have been achieved and these awards have partially vested.

For the 2020 grant, if Operating Profit is in excess of £100m, 1% of the award will vest for every additional £1m of Operating
Profit achieved, up to a maximum of 100% at Operating Profit of £200m or more. As Operating Profit of £196.1m was achieved
in 2022, 96% of the performance criteria have been achieved and these awards have partially vested.

For the 2021 grant, if Operating Profit is in excess of £75m, 25% of the award will vest. 1% of the award will vest for every
additional £1m of Operating Profit achieved, up to a maximum of 100% at Operating Profit of £150m or more. As Operating
Profit of £118.8m was achieved in 2023, 68% of the performance criteria have been achieved and these awards have partially
vested.

For the 2022 grant, if Operating Profit is in excess of £125m, 25% of the award will vest. 1% of the award will vest for every
additional £1m of Operating Profit achieved, up to a maximum of 100% at Operating Profit of £200m or more.

For the 2023 grant, if Operating Profit is in excess of £125m, 1% of the award will vest for every additional £1m of Operating
Profit achieved, up to a maximum of 100% at Operating Profit of £225m or more.


### Other share-based payment plans

The Company also operates a Management Incentive Plan for the Executive Directors and senior employees and a Long-Term
Incentive Plan for the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other senior employees. Details of these plans are
disclosed in the Directors' Remuneration Report and are settled by the physical delivery of shares, currently satisfied by shares
held in the Employee Benefit Trust, to the extent that service and performance conditions are met. Movements on these plans
are shown below:

### Share option valuation and measurement

In 2023, options were granted on 16 March with the estimated fair value of £0.92 (2022: granted on 15 March with the
estimated fair value of £0.97). Share options are granted under service and non-market performance conditions. These
conditions are not taken into account in the fair value measurement at grant date. There are no market conditions associated
with the share option grants. The options outstanding at 31 December 2023 have an exercise price in the range of 332p to
534p and a weighted average contractual life of 6.7 years. The fair values of options and other share awards granted during the
year were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The inputs into the model were as follows:

Expected volatility was determined by reference to historical volatility of the Company's share price in the last 36 months. The
expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management's best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability,
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. Expectations of early exercise are incorporated into the Black-Scholes
option pricing model.

The Group recognised total expenses of £5.5m, excluding social security, (2022: £6.0m) related to share-based payment
transactions during the year.

The Group operates multi-currency cash concentration and notional cash pools, and an interest enhancement facility. The Eurozone
subsidiaries and the UK-based Group Treasury subsidiary participate in the cash concentration arrangement, the Group Treasury
subsidiary retains the notional cash pool and the Asia Pacific subsidiaries operate the interest enhancement facility. The structures
facilitate interest compensation of cash whilst supporting working capital requirements.


# 22. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:

(i) credit risk

(ii) liquidity risk

(iii) market risk

This note presents information about the Group's exposure to each of the above risks, the Group's objectives, policies and
processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group's management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included
throughout these consolidated financial statements.

The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework.

The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk
limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to
reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and
procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and
obligations.

The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies and procedures
and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Audit Committee
is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management
controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.


## (i) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual
obligations, and arises principally from the Group's receivables from clients. Management has a credit policy in place and the
exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.

At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk is
represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet.


### Trade and other receivables

Total trade receivables (net of allowances) held by the Group at 31 December 2023 amounted to £270.5m (2022: £307.8m).

An initial credit period is made available on invoices. No interest is charged on trade receivables from the date of the invoice
during this credit period. An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using a provision matrix to measure the
expected credit losses. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience
adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

Included in the Group's trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £106.0m (2022: £127.3m) that are past
due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as the amounts are still considered recoverable. The Group does
not hold any collateral over these balances. The days' sales of these receivables at the year end is 42 days in excess of the initial
credit period (2022: 45 days).

In the table below, the provision includes expected credit losses.

The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was:

</table>


The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each client. The demographics of
the Group's client base, including the country in which clients operate, also has an influence on credit risk. The geographic
diversification of the Group's revenue also reduces the concentration of credit risk.

The majority of the Group's clients have been transacting with the Group for several years, with losses rarely occurring. In
monitoring client credit risk, clients are grouped according to their credit characteristics, including geographic location, industry,
ageing profile, maturity and existence of previous financial difficulties.

The allowance for expected credit losses represents a provision for debts which the Group estimate may be irrecoverable,
including £6.7m (2022: £6.7m) of debts in litigation.

The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present
value of the expected liquidation proceeds. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

The fair values of trade and other receivables are not materially different to those disclosed above and in note 14. There is no
material effect on pre-tax profit if the instruments are accounted for at fair value or amortised cost.


## (ii) Liquidity risk management

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management
framework that aims to ensure that the Group has sufficient cash or credit facilities at all times to meet all current and forecast
liabilities as they fall due. It is the Directors' intention to continue to finance the activities and development of the Group from
retained earnings.

Cash surpluses were invested in short-term deposits, with any working capital requirements being provided from Group cash
resources, Group facilities, or by local overdraft facilities. The Group also operates a multi-currency notional cash pool to facilitate
interest and balance compensation of cash and bank overdrafts.

The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities:


<table>
<tr>
<th>2023</th>

The above are the contractual cashflows before discounting at the incremental borrowing rate.

Capital is equity attributable to the equity holders of the Parent. The primary objective of the Group's capital management is to
ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios to support the business and maximise Shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or
adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to Shareholders, return capital to Shareholders through
share repurchases with subsequent cancellation, or issue new shares. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or
processes for managing capital during the years ended 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022.


## (iii) Market risk and sensitivity analysis

The Group's activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates,
but these risks are not deemed to be material. However, a sensitivity analysis showing hypothetical fluctuations in Sterling against
the Group's main exposure currencies is shown on the next page. There has been no material change in the Group's exposure to
market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk.


### Interest rate risk management

Borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group does not consider this
risk as significant. The benchmark rates for determining floating rate liabilities are based on relevant national LIBOR equivalents.


### Currency rate risk

The Group publishes its results in Sterling and conducts its business in many foreign currencies. As a result, the Group is subject
to foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange rate movements. The Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk
as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of some of its subsidiaries and the translation of the
results and underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries.

The main functional currencies of the Group are Sterling, Euro, Chinese Renminbi, Swiss Franc, Singapore Dollar, Hong Kong
Dollar, Australian Dollar and US Dollar. The Group does not have material transactional currency exposures. The Group is
exposed to foreign currency translation differences in accounting for its overseas operations. The Group policy is not to hedge
translation exposure.

In certain cases, where the Company gives or receives short-term loans to and from other Group companies with different
reporting currencies, it may use foreign exchange rate derivatives to manage the currency exposure that arises on these loans.
It is the Group's policy not to seek to designate these derivatives as hedges.

All derivative financial instruments are classified as derivatives at fair value through the income statement. The Group does not
use derivatives for speculative purposes. All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks
arising from underlying business activities.

Information on the fair value of derivative financial instruments held at the balance sheet date is shown in the table below. Net
losses of £1.8m (2022: gains of £3.4m) have been included as part of the foreign exchange losses for the year (note 3).

Fair values are not adjusted for credit risk, as required by IFRS 13, because credit impact is not material given the low fair value
levels. All derivative instruments are classified as level 2 instruments.

### Sensitivity analysis - currency risk

A 10% strengthening of Sterling against the following currencies at 31 December 2023 would have increased/(decreased) equity
and profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This is reflective of the exchange rates movements experienced by the Group
over the last 3 years. This analysis is applied currency by currency in isolation, i.e. ignoring the impact of currency correlation,
and assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. The analysis is performed on the same basis
for 2022. The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain
adverse market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected, due to developments in
the global financial markets which may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts
disclosed in the table below, which therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.
