# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 December 2023

## 1. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

### Statement of compliance
PageGroup plc is a Company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act.

Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards ("IFRSs").

### Basis of preparation
The financial statements of PageGroup plc consolidate the results of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings. As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss account of the Company has not been included as part of these financial statements. The Company's profit for the financial year amounted to £98.0m (2022: £150.8m).

The Group's consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an accruals basis and under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of derivatives. The Group's financials are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (£'000) except when otherwise indicated.

### Basis of consolidation

**(i) Subsidiaries**

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as at 31 December 2023. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.

**(ii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation**

Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

**(iii) Employee Benefit Trust**

Shares in PageGroup plc held by the trust are shown as a reduction in Shareholders' funds.

**(iv) Changes in accounting policy – new accounting standards, interpretations and amendments**

The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial years except for the following amendments to IFRS effective as of 1 January 2023:

* Amendments to IAS 12: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a single transaction
* Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practices Statement 2 - Disclosure of accounting policies

The adoption of these accounting standards or interpretations did not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Group.

* IAS 12 International Tax Reform: Pillar Two Model Rules

On 19 July 2023, the UK Endorsement Board adopted the Amendments to IAS 12 International Tax Reform: Pillar Two Model Rules, issued by the IASB in May 2023. PageGroup has applied the mandatory temporary exemption to the accounting for deferred taxes arising from the jurisdictional implementation of the Pillar Two model rules. Further details are included at note 7.

### Standards issued but not yet effective

The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Group's financial statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they become effective.

* Amendments to IAS 1: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current; effective date 1 January 2024
* Amendments to IAS 1: Non-current liabilities with Covenants; effective date 1 January 2024

The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group.

### Going concern

The Board has undertaken a review of the Group's forecasts and associated risks and sensitivities, in the period from the date of approval of the financial statements to March 2025 (review period).

The Board considered a variety of downsides that the Group might experience, such as a global downturn, a cyber-attack resulting in significant reputational damage and loss of clients and candidates, and the Group's business model becoming ineffective due to new innovations such as recruitment via social media. All modelled scenarios would be expected to impact gross profit and headcount, impacting conversion.

The Group had £90.1m of cash as at 31 December 2023, with no debt except for IFRS 16 lease liabilities of £110.9m. Debt facilities relevant to the review period comprise a committed £80m RCF maturing December 2027, an uncommitted UK trade debtor discounting facility (up to £50m depending on debtor levels) and an uncommitted £20m UK bank overdraft facility. Under these latest forecasts, the Group is able to operate without the need to draw on its available facilities. The forecast cash flows indicate that the Group will comply with all relevant banking covenants during the review period.

Despite the macroeconomic and political uncertainty that currently exists, and its inherent risk and impact on the business, based on the analysis performed there are no plausible downside scenarios that the Board believes would cause a liquidity issue.

Given the Group's resilient performance in 2023, the level of cash in the business and the Group's borrowing facilities, the geographical and discipline diversification, limited Customer concentration risk, as well as the ability to manage the cost base, the Board has concluded that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation, meet its liabilities as they fall due, retain sufficient available cash and not breach the covenants under the RCF for the foreseeable future, being a period of at least 12 months from the date of the approval of the financial statements. The Board therefore considers it appropriate for the Group to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements.

PageGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2023 | 147  
PageGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2023 | 148
a) Revenue and income recognition
Revenue, which excludes value added tax (VAT), constitutes the value of services undertaken by the Group from its principal activities, which are recruitment consultancy and other ancillary services. These consist of:
•	revenue from temporary placements, which represents amounts billed for the services of temporary staff, including the salary cost of these staff. This is recognised when the service has been provided;
•	revenue from permanent placements is typically based on a percentage of the candidate's remuneration package and is derived from both retained assignments (income recognised on completion of defined stages of work) and non-retained assignments (income recognised at the date an offer is accepted by a candidate and where a start date has been determined). The latter includes revenue anticipated, but not invoiced, at the balance sheet date, which is correspondingly accrued on the balance sheet within accrued income. A provision is made against accrued income for possible cancellations of placements prior to, or shortly after, the commencement of employment; and 
•	revenue from amounts billed to clients for expenses incurred on their behalf (principally advertisements) is recognised when the expense is incurred.

The present value of revenue recognised is equal to the cash funds receivable as invoices are settled within a year of initial recognition. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.

b) Cost of sales
Cost of sales consists of the salary cost of temporary staff and costs incurred on behalf of clients, principally advertising costs.

c) Gross profit
Gross profit represents revenue less cost of sales and consists of the total placement fees of permanent candidates, the margin earned on the placement of temporary candidates and the margin on advertising income.

d) Foreign currency translation
(i) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ("the functional currency"). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Company's functional and presentation currency.

(ii) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.

(iii) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
•	assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
•	income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates; and
•	all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.

e) Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised, but is tested at least annually for impairment (see accounting policy h). Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.

(ii) Computer software 
Computer software acquired separately is measured on initial recognition at cost. Computer software developed by the Group is measured at the cost incurred in relation to the development of software and related applications. Costs are capitalised when they fulfil the criteria in IAS 38 regarding internally developed intangible assets. The Group applies judgement, which is not considered as significant, in capitalising the development cost by assessing if it will generate probable future economic benefits. Costs which are incurred after the release of software or costs which are incurred in order to enhance existing products are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

(iii) Software under construction
Software under construction relates to cost capitalised in relation to the development of a new operating system and related applications. Costs are capitalised when they fulfil the criteria in IAS 38 regarding internally developed intangible assets. While still under construction, assets are tested for impairment annually. Assets are moved from software under construction to computer software when they become available for use.

(iv) Trademark
Acquired trademarks are stated at cost and are written down over five years on a straight-line basis, which represents the estimated useful life of the intangible asset.

(v) Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life. Computer software is amortised at 20% per annum unless it is considered to have a shorter life, in which case the period of amortisation is reduced. The cumulative amount of goodwill written off directly to retained earnings in respect of acquisitions prior to 31 December 1997 is £311.7m (2022: £311.7m).

f) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset evenly over its expected useful life at the following rates:
•	Leasehold improvements 10% per annum or period of lease if shorter
•	Furniture, fixtures and equipment 10-20% per annum
•	Motor vehicles 25% per annum

g) Investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment.

h) Impairment of assets
(i) Non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. 

The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).

(ii) Financial assets
The Company and Group recognise an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate.

ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).

For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment as well as potential cancellations.

i) Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax charges. The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit or that did not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.

Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to OCI or equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in OCI or equity. 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

IAS 12 has been amended to add the exception to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities that are related to tax law enacted or substantively enacted to implement the Pillar Two model rules published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (the "Pillar Two legislation"). The amendments require that entities shall disclose separately its current tax expense/ income related to Pillar Two income taxes, and the qualitative and quantitative information about its exposure to Pillar Two income taxes. The Group will disclose known or reasonably estimable information that helps users of financial statements to understand the Group's exposure to Pillar Two income taxes.

j) Pension costs
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds. The pension costs charged to the income statement represent the contributions payable by the Group to the funds during each period.

k) Leases
(i) Right-of-use assets
The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognised right-of-use assets

PageGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2023 149
PageGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2023 150
are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment.

(ii) Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term.

The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expense in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made.

In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.

(iii) Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of machinery and equipment (i.e. those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered of low value (i.e. below £5,000). Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

iv) Judgement in determining the lease term of contracts with renewal options
The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.

The Group has the option, under some of its leases to lease the assets for additional terms of three to ten years. The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise (or not to exercise) the option to renew (e.g. a change in business strategy).

l) Segment reporting
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Board to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance. Information provided to the Board is focused on regions and as a result, reportable segments are on a regional basis. Transactions between segments are recorded and allocated on an arms-length basis.

m) Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company's Shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group's financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by (for final dividends) or paid to (for interim dividends) the Company's Shareholders.

n) Share-based compensation 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The accounting treatments for the Group and Parent Company are described below:

(i) Share option schemes
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense in the income statement of the Group with a corresponding adjustment to equity. In the parent company, it is capitalised as an investment, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, earnings per share). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.

At each balance sheet date, the estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable is revised. The Group recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and the corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.

(ii) Management Incentive Plan
Where deferred awards are made to Directors and senior executives under the Management Incentive Plan, to reflect that the awards are for services over a longer period, the value of the expected award is charged to the income statement of the Group on a straight-line basis over the vesting period to which the award relates. In the Parent Company, it is capitalised as an investment in the subsidiary that is receiving the employee service, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

(iii) Employee Single Incentive Plan (ESIP)
Awards under the ESIP are paid in cash (40%) and Shares (60%), which vest in three tranches over a three-year period. The value of expected award is charged to the income statement of the Group relative to these vesting periods.

(iv) Tax on share schemes
Where options or shares are net settled in respect of withholding tax obligations, these are accounted for as equity settled transactions. Payments to local tax authorities are accounted for as a deduction from equity for the shares withheld.

o) Deferred cash bonus
The Group operates a bonus scheme for some members of staff whereby bonuses are deferred for three years from date of award. The bonuses are paid in full if the employee remains employed for the entire three-year period.

p) Repurchase of share capital
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including any directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity.

q) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors' best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.

r) Pension liabilities
The Group has an unfunded retirement indemnity plan relating to a pension scheme in France. At 31 December 2023, the Group's commitment was £2.3m (2022: £0.6m) with the movement due to changes in actuarial assumptions recognised in other comprehensive income.

There are some further statutory schemes in other territories not recognised in the financial statements, which are immaterial individually and in aggregate.

s) Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, and subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI), and fair value through profit or loss.

The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial assets' contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group's business model for managing them. With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price determined under IFRS 15.

The Group's financial assets at amortised cost include trade and other receivables. In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are "solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)" on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level.

The Group's business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both.

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash-in-hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows. Prepayments and accrued income are held at amortised cost.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

The Group's financial liabilities include trade and other payables and derivative financial instruments.

Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Group has derivative contracts at the balance sheet date that have been valued at fair value through the income statement.

t) Areas of accounting estimation
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of certain accounting estimates and judgements. It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Company's accounting policies.

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements management has considered the impact of climate change, particularly in the context of the risks identified in the TCFD disclosures on pages 52 to 57 this year and the stated Net Zero targets. These considerations did not have a material impact on the financial reporting judgements and estimates. In particular, management has considered the impact of climate change in respect of the following areas:

• the Group's going concern assessment to March 2025 and viability of the Group over the next three years;
• cash flow forecasts used in the impairment assessment of non-current assets including goodwill; and
• carrying value and useful economic lives of plant, property and equipment and intangibles.

Whilst there is no medium-term impact expected from climate change, management is aware of the ever-evolving risks associated with climate change and will continue to monitor these and their impact on the judgements and estimates made in the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.

The following are areas where appropriate accounting necessarily involves management judgement and estimation. However, none of the estimates described are considered to have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the related assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Accordingly, they are not considered to be major sources of estimation uncertainty.

(i) Trade and other receivables
There is uncertainty regarding Customers who may not be able to pay as their invoices fall due as at 31 December 2023. In total the Group holds £281.7m of Gross Trade Receivables (2022: £320.8m). A provision for £11.1m (2022: £13.0m) has been recognised based on the expected credit losses, cancellations or balances which are in litigation.

In reviewing the appropriateness of the provisions in respect of recoverability of trade receivables, consideration has been given to the economic climate in the respective markets, the ageing of the debt and the potential likelihood of default. If the economic climate was to deteriorate across a number of countries the portfolio could be impaired by an amount greater than materiality. This scenario is however considered sufficiently remote such that no reasonably possible changes in assumptions are likely to cause material further impairment next year. Please see note 22 for an analysis of expected credit losses and cancellations.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
(ii) Deferred Tax

At 31 December 2023, PageGroup's deferred tax assets are £19.9m (2022: £18.6m). The ultimate realisation of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible or in which tax losses can be utilised. The tax effect of deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses are recognised as a deferred tax asset when it becomes probable that the tax losses and deductible temporary differences will be utilised. In making assessments regarding deferred tax assets, management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, the availability to carry back losses and tax planning strategies.

At 31 December 2023, based upon the projections for future taxable income over the periods in which deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes that it is more likely than not that PageGroup will realise the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realisable could however be reduced in subsequent years if estimates of future taxable income during their carry forward periods are reduced, or rulings by the tax authorities are unfavourable. Estimates are therefore subject to change due to both market-related and government-related uncertainties, as well as PageGroup's own future decisions.

(iii) Uncertain tax positions

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Uncertain tax positions are assessed and measured on an issue by issue basis within the jurisdictions that we operate using management's estimate of the most likely outcome. Where management determines that a greater than 50% probability exists that the tax authorities would accept the position taken in the tax return, amounts are recognised in the consolidated financial statements on that basis. Where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is uncertain, the Group recognises a liability or asset based on either: management's judgement of the most likely outcome; or, when there is a wide range of possible outcomes, a probability weighted average approach. The Group recognises interest on late paid taxes as part of financing costs. The Group recognises penalties, if applicable, as part of administrative and other expenses.

These estimates include management judgements about the probable outcome of uncertain tax positions. Management base their judgements on the latest information available about the positions expected to be taken by each tax authority. Actual outcomes and settlements may differ from the estimates recorded in these consolidated financial statements however we do not anticipate a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment. The uncertain tax position provision recognised as at 31 December 2023 is £3.3m (2022: £3.0m).

u) Employee Benefit Trust

The Employee Benefit Trust is considered a separate legal entity and not an extension of the Parent Company. It is included in the consolidated results of the Group as it is deemed to have control of the entity.

The analysis below is of the carrying amount of reportable segment assets, liabilities and non-current assets. Segment assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. The individual reportable segments exclude income tax assets and liabilities. Non-current assets include property, plant and equipment, computer software, goodwill and other intangibles.

2. SEGMENT REPORTING

All revenues disclosed are derived from external Customers.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group's accounting policies described in Note 1. Segment operating profit represents the profit earned by each segment including allocation of central administration costs. This is the measure reported to the Group's Board, the chief operating decision maker, for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance. Segments are aggregated in accordance with management ownership, determined by the possession of similar characteristics such as geography, market maturity and economic environment. No judgements were applied to identify the reportable segments.

We have generated profits in overseas countries which have higher tax rates and are subject to additional taxes on profits which have contributed 5.6% to the tax rate in 2023. Disallowable and other permanent differences are broadly in line with prior years and contributed 2.4% to the tax rate in 2023. Net derecognition of overseas losses and other tax attributes, that we could not recognise due to the requirement to have profits against which to offset in the foreseeable future, increase the rate by 2.3%. Adjustments in respect of prior periods are one-off in nature and had a negligible impact. These combine to add to the basic UK rate of 23.5% to give the total effective tax rate of 34.4%.

The UK corporation tax rate increased to 25% (from 19%) on 1 April 2023. This was previously enacted in 2021 and UK deferred taxes at balance sheet dates have been measured using these enacted tax rates and reflected in these financial statements.

# 7. CURRENT TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

The current tax asset of £23.4m (2022: £17.2m), and current tax liability of £6.0m (2022: £18.1m) for the Group, and current tax asset and liability of £nil (2022: £nil) for the Parent Company, represent the amount of income taxes recoverable and payable in respect of current and prior periods.

Pillar Two legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted in certain jurisdictions in which the Group operates, including the UK. The legislation will be effective for the Group's financial year beginning 1 January 2024. The Group is in scope of the Pillar Two legislation and has performed an assessment of the Group's potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes. The assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes is based on the most recent country-by-country reporting prepared for the Group and management is not currently aware of any circumstances under which this might change. Based on this assessment, the Group does not expect any material potential exposure to Pillar Two top-up taxes.

| Proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2023 of 11.24p per ordinary share (2022: 10.76p) | 35,449 | 34,207 |

The proposed final dividend had not been approved by the Board at 31 December 2023 and therefore has not been included as a liability. The proposed final dividend of 11.24p (2022: 10.76p) per ordinary share will be paid on 21 June 2024 to Shareholders on the register at close of business on 17 May 2024.

# 9. EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE

The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data:

|  | 2023 | 2022 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
|  | **£'000** | **£'000** |
| **Earnings** |  |  |
| Earnings for basic and diluted earnings per share (£'000) | 77,068 | 139,012 |

| Number of shares | number | number |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Weighted average number of shares used for basic earnings per share ('000) | 315,784 | 318,166 |
| Dilutive effect of share plans ('000) | 1,311 | 1,204 |
| Diluted weighted average number of shares used for diluted earnings per share ('000) | 317,095 | 319,370 |

|  | pence | pence |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Basic earnings per share | 24.4 | 43.7 |
| Diluted earnings per share | 24.3 | 43.5 |

The above results relate to continuing operations.

**Basic**

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding unallocated ordinary shares purchased by the Employee Benefit Trust and held in the reserve.

**Diluted**

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. This calculation determines the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average market price of the Company's shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the outstanding share options. The number of shares calculated in the basic earnings per share is then adjusted to reflect the number of shares deemed to be issued for nil consideration as a result of the potential exercise of existing share options. The remaining share options that are currently not dilutive and hence excluded from the dilutive earnings per share calculation remain potentially dilutive until they are either exercised or they lapse.

## IMPAIRMENT TESTS FOR GOODWILL

Goodwill is allocated to the Group's cash-generating units (CGUs) identified according to the country of operation. A summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below:

| | 2023<br>£'000 | 2022<br>£'000 |
|---|---:|---:|
| UK | 1,274 | 1,274 |
| USA | 214 | 214 |
| Singapore | 51 | 51 |
| | 1,539 | 1,539 |

In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are calculated by preparing cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budget, management projections for five years, followed by an assumed growth rate of 0% (2022: 0%), which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the relevant markets and reflects long-term wage inflation fee growth. Management applied a discount rate of 8% (2022: 8%), representing the weighted average cost of capital for the Group, to the estimated future cash flows to calculate the terminal value of those cash flows. If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense. Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of goodwill allocated to any CGU to materially exceed its recoverable amount.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. It is the opinion of the Directors that at 31 December 2023 there was no impairment of goodwill.

**Dilapidation**
A provision has been recognised for dilapidation costs associated with our office portfolio, where the Group is committed to make good on the property sites on lease termination.

**Social security contributions on share options**
The provision for social security contributions on share options is calculated based on the number of options outstanding at the reporting date that are expected to be exercised. The provision is based on market price of the shares at the reporting date which is the best estimate of the market price at the date of exercise. It is expected that the costs will be incurred during the exercise period of 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2024.

The following are the major deferred tax assets/(liabilities) recognised by the Group, and the movements thereon, during the current and prior reporting periods.

| | Share-based payments £'000 | Tax losses £'000 | Provisions £'000 | Related party transactions £'000 | Other £'000 | Total £'000 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| At 31 December 2022 | 1,064 | 881 | 9,945 | 4,677 | 729 | 17,296 |

The temporary differences shown under "Other" of (£0.1m) (2022: £0.7m) predominantly includes such differences in relation to fixed assets (£2.6m) (2022: £0.8m), differences between the Group GAAP, IFRS, and the local GAAP of each country in which PageGroup operates and differences between recognition of income and expense for accounting and tax purposes and other items of (£1.1m) (2022: £3.4m), IFRS 16 of £1.3m (2022: £1.1m) and other items of £2.3m (2022: £2.2m). The realisation of the deferred tax asset in respect of losses is dependent upon generating future taxable profits in the territories in which the deferred tax assets have arisen.

The recognition of deferred income tax assets is supported by management's forecasts of future profitability of the relevant countries. Management consider these forecasts are sufficiently reliable to support recovery of these assets. Where the forecasts of future profits are insufficient to support recovery, no deferred income tax assets have been recognised.

The net deferred tax asset of £17.5m (2022: £17.3m) includes £5.8m of deferred tax assets in relation to entities that have incurred an accounting loss in either 2023 and 2022. In line with the most recent budgets which forecast profits for these entities, management expects these losses to be substantially recovered within three years.

At 31 December 2023, £41.3m (2022: £40.8m) of deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and tax credits have not been recognised due to uncertainty over the taxable profits available to support the realisation of these attributes. The tax effected balances are £12.8m (2022: £12.3m).

The balance includes gross unrecognised tax losses of £29.0m (2022: £26.8m) of which £23.5m have no expiry, £1.6m that will expire at various dates to 31 December 2028 with the remainder of £3.9m expiring at various dates to 31 December 2034. The single most material country which has unrecognised tax losses is Brazil with £21m (2022: £16m).

The Group's overseas subsidiaries have net unremitted earnings of £161.8m (2022: £188.7m), resulting in temporary differences of £27.1m.(2022: £33.9m). No deferred tax has been provided in respect of these differences since the timing of the reversals can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

# 17. GROUP BORROWING FACILITIES

At 31 December 2023, the Group had an available £80m committed RCF facility maturing 9 December 2027, uncommitted bank overdraft facilities of £21m (2022: £21m), and an uncommitted £50m invoice discounting arrangement with HSBC Limited based on the carrying amount of UK trade receivables of £30.5m (2022: £22.4m). None of the facilities were drawn at year end (2022: £nil).

All uncommitted facilities are repayable on demand. The Group's exposure to interest rate, foreign currency and liquidity risk for financial assets and liabilities is disclosed in Note 22.

# 18. DEFERRED TAX

Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where permissible in accordance with the Group's accounting policy.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances (after offset) for balance sheet purposes:

| | 2023 £'000 | 2022 £'000 |
|---|---|---|
| Deferred tax assets | 19,856 | 18,641 |

## Note 1
### Share Option Scheme 
Executive Directors of the Company are not eligible to participate in this plan. Any exercises of awards made under this plan are settled by shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust.

This share option scheme was created in 2009 to provide an effective plan under which to grant awards from 2009 onwards. It was the Board's view that grants made under the existing ESOS, which would have required an increase over the 2008 base earnings per share of at least 3% per annum above the growth in the UK Retail Price Index by 2011, would not be achievable due to the impact of the global downturn on the Group's EPS and thus would not provide the required retention incentive. Further grants under the SOS have been made in each year from 2011. The performance conditions for these grants are also linked directly to the Group's Operating Profit.

For grants between 2012 and 2015, if Operating Profit is in excess of £50m, a proportion of the award equivalent to the amount of Operating Profit achieved will vest up to a maximum of 100% if the Operating Profit is £100m or more. As Operating Profit of £118.3m was achieved in 2017, the performance criteria have been fully achieved and these awards have fully vested.

For the 2016 grant, if Operating Profit is in excess of £75m, 2% of the award will vest for every additional £1m of Operating Profit achieved, up to a maximum of 100% at Operating Profit of £125m or more. As Operating Profit of £142.5m was achieved in 2018, the performance criteria have been fully achieved and these awards have fully vested.

For the 2017 grant, if Operating Profit is in excess of £50m, 25% of the award will vest, 1% of the award will vest for every additional £1m of Operating Profit achieved, up to a maximum of 100% at Operating Profit of £125m or more. As Operating Profit of £146.7m was achieved in 2019, the performance criteria have been fully achieved and these awards have fully vested.

For the 2018 grant, if Operating Profit is in excess of £75m, 25% of the award will vest. 1% of the award will vest for every additional £1m of Operating Profit achieved, up to a maximum of 100% at Operating Profit of £150m or more. As Operating Profit of £168.5m was achieved in 2021, the performance criteria have been fully achieved and these awards have fully vested.

For the 2019 grant, if Operating Profit is in excess of £100m, 1% of the award will vest for every additional £1m of Operating Profit achieved, up to a maximum of 100% at Operating Profit of £200m or more. As Operating Profit of £196.1m was achieved in 2022, 96% of the performance criteria have been achieved and these awards have partially vested.

For the 2020 grant, if Operating Profit is in excess of £100m, 1% of the award will vest for every additional £1m of Operating Profit achieved, up to a maximum of 100% at Operating Profit of £200m or more. As Operating Profit of £196.1m was achieved in 2022, 96% of the performance criteria have been achieved and these awards have partially vested.

For the 2021 grant, if Operating Profit is in excess of £75m, 25% of the award will vest. 1% of the award will vest for every additional £1m of Operating Profit achieved, up to a maximum of 100% at Operating Profit of £150m or more. As Operating Profit of £118.8m was achieved in 2023, 68% of the performance criteria have been achieved and these awards have partially vested.

For the 2022 grant, if Operating Profit is in excess of £125m, 25% of the award will vest. 1% of the award will vest for every additional £1m of Operating Profit achieved, up to a maximum of 100% at Operating Profit of £200m or more.

For the 2023 grant, if Operating Profit is in excess of £125m, 1% of the award will vest for every additional £1m of Operating Profit achieved, up to a maximum of 100% at Operating Profit of £225m or more.

## Other share-based payment plans
The Company also operates a Management Incentive Plan for the Executive Directors and senior employees and a Long-Term Incentive Plan for the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other senior employees. Details of these plans are disclosed in the Directors' Remuneration Report and are settled by the physical delivery of shares, currently satisfied by shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust, to the extent that service and performance conditions are met. Movements on these plans are shown below:

| | LTIP/ESIP | MIP |
|---|---|---|
| As at 1 January 2023 | 607,990 | 2,369,265 |
| Granted | 303,566 | 1,043,446 |
| Lapsed | – | (430,995) |
| Exercised | (221,016) | (548,085) |
| As at 31 December 2023 | 690,540 | 2,433,631 |

## Share option valuation and measurement
In 2023, options were granted on 16 March with the estimated fair value of £0.92 (2022: granted on 15 March with the estimated fair value of £0.97). Share options are granted under service and non-market performance conditions. These conditions are not taken into account in the fair value measurement at grant date. There are no market conditions associated with the share option grants. The options outstanding at 31 December 2023 have an exercise price in the range of 332p to 534p and a weighted average contractual life of 6.7 years. The fair values of options and other share awards granted during the year were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The inputs into the model were as follows:

| | Share Option Plans | | Management Incentive Plan | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |
| Share price (£) | 4.40 | 4.92 | 4.40 | 4.92 |
| Average exercise price (£) | 4.40 | 4.92 | Nil | Nil |
| Weighted average fair value (£) | 0.92 | 0.97 | 3.58 | 3.93 |
| Expected volatility | 38.31% | 38.14% | 38.31% | 38.14% |
| Expected life | 5 years | 5 years | 3 years | 3 years |
| Risk free rate | 4.69% | 1.76% | 4.69% | 1.76% |
| Expected dividend yield | 6.87% | 5.82% | 6.87% | 5.82% |

Expected volatility was determined by reference to historical volatility of the Company's share price in the last 36 months. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management's best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. Expectations of early exercise are incorporated into the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

The Group recognised total expenses of £5.5m, excluding social security, (2022: £6.0m) related to share-based payment transactions during the year.

# 20. RESERVES

## Share premium
The share premium account has been established to represent the excess of proceeds over the nominal value for all share issues, including the excess of the exercise share price over the nominal value of the shares on the exercise of share options.

## Capital redemption reserve
The capital redemption reserve relates to the cancellation of the Company's own shares.

## Reserve for shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust

# 21. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

| | Group | | | Company | |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

The Group operates multi-currency cash concentration and notional cash pools, and an interest enhancement facility. The Eurozone subsidiaries and the UK-based Group Treasury subsidiary participate in the cash concentration arrangement, the Group Treasury subsidiary retains the notional cash pool and the Asia Pacific subsidiaries operate the interest enhancement facility. The structures facilitate interest compensation of cash whilst supporting working capital requirements.

# 22. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:

(i) credit risk

(ii) liquidity risk

(iii) market risk

This note presents information about the Group's exposure to each of the above risks, the Group's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group's management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.

The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework.

The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.

The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.

## (i) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's receivables from clients. Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.

At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet.

## Trade and other receivables
Total trade receivables (net of allowances) held by the Group at 31 December 2023 amounted to £270.5m (2022: £307.8m).

An initial credit period is made available on invoices. No interest is charged on trade receivables from the date of the invoice during this credit period. An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using a provision matrix to measure the expected credit losses. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

Included in the Group's trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £106.0m (2022: £127.3m) that are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as the amounts are still considered recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. The days' sales of these receivables at the year end is 42 days in excess of the initial credit period (2022: 45 days).

In the table below, the provision includes expected credit losses.

The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was:

| | 2023 | | | 2022 | |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

| Not past due | 165,572 | (1,066) | 164,506 | 181,728 | (1,155) | 180,573 |
| Past due 0-30 days | 62,744 | (405) | 62,339 | 71,646 | (456) | 71,190 |

The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each client. The demographics of the Group's client base, including the country in which clients operate, also has an influence on credit risk. The geographic diversification of the Group's revenue also reduces the concentration of credit risk.

The majority of the Group's clients have been transacting with the Group for several years, with losses rarely occurring. In monitoring client credit risk, clients are grouped according to their credit characteristics, including geographic location, industry, ageing profile, maturity and existence of previous financial difficulties.

## Movement in the allowance for expected credit losses

| | 2023 £'000 | 2022 £'000 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Balance at beginning of the year | 12,960 | 11,086 |
| Expected credit losses recognised on receivables | 35,114 | 25,265 |
| Amounts written off as uncollectable | (3,278) | (2,914) |
| Amounts recovered/reversed during the year | (33,652) | (20,477) |
| Balance at end of the year | 11,144 | 12,960 |

The allowance for expected credit losses represents a provision for debts which the Group estimate may be irrecoverable, including £6.7m (2022: £6.7m) of debts in litigation.

The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of the expected liquidation proceeds. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
# Exposure to credit risk

The maximum exposure to credit risk for receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was:

| Net trade receivables | 2023<br>£'000 | 2022<br>£'000 |
|----------------------|----------------|----------------|
| EMEA                 | 171,473        | 191,699        |
| United Kingdom       | 36,521         | 45,101         |
| Asia Pacific         | 27,903         | 32,027         |
| Americas             | 34,611         | 39,007         |
|                      | 270,508        | 307,834        |

The fair values of trade and other receivables are not materially different to those disclosed above and in note 14. There is no material effect on pre-tax profit if the instruments are accounted for at fair value or amortised cost.

## (ii) Liquidity risk management

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework that aims to ensure that the Group has sufficient cash or credit facilities at all times to meet all current and forecast liabilities as they fall due. It is the Directors' intention to continue to finance the activities and development of the Group from retained earnings.

Cash surpluses were invested in short-term deposits, with any working capital requirements being provided from Group cash resources, Group facilities, or by local overdraft facilities. The Group also operates a multi-currency notional cash pool to facilitate interest and balance compensation of cash and bank overdrafts.

The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities:

| 2023 | Less than<br>1 month<br>£'000 | 1-3<br>months<br>£'000 | 3-12<br>months<br>£'000 | More than<br>12 months<br>£'000 |
|------|-------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Lease liabilities | 2,832 | 5,664 | 25,487 | 84,641 |
| Trade payables | 6,915 | 1,451 | 16 | - |
| Accruals and other payables | 124,431 | 29,368 | 36,116 | 9,111 |

| 2022 | Less than<br>1 month<br>£'000 | 1-3<br>months<br>£'000 | 3-12<br>months<br>£'000 | More than<br>12 months<br>£'000 |
|------|-------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Lease liabilities | 3,432 | 5,503 | 24,547 | 81,685 |
| Trade payables | 10,547 | 349 | 191 | – |
| Accruals and other payables | 154,942 | 26,657 | 34,969 | 14,259 |

The above are the contractual cashflows before discounting at the incremental borrowing rate.

Capital is equity attributable to the equity holders of the Parent. The primary objective of the Group's capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios to support the business and maximise Shareholder value. The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to Shareholders, return capital to Shareholders through share repurchases with subsequent cancellation, or issue new shares. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the years ended 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022.

## (iii) Market risk and sensitivity analysis

The Group's activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, but these risks are not deemed to be material. However, a sensitivity analysis showing hypothetical fluctuations in Sterling against the Group's main exposure currencies is shown on the next page. There has been no material change in the Group's exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk.

### Interest rate risk management

Borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group does not consider this risk as significant. The benchmark rates for determining floating rate liabilities are based on relevant national LIBOR equivalents.

# Currency rate risk

The Group publishes its results in Sterling and conducts its business in many foreign currencies. As a result, the Group is subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange rate movements. The Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of some of its subsidiaries and the translation of the results and underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries.

The main functional currencies of the Group are Sterling, Euro, Chinese Renminbi, Swiss Franc, Singapore Dollar, Hong Kong Dollar, Australian Dollar and US Dollar. The Group does not have material transactional currency exposures. The Group is exposed to foreign currency translation differences in accounting for its overseas operations. The Group policy is not to hedge translation exposure.

In certain cases, where the Company gives or receives short-term loans to and from other Group companies with different reporting currencies, it may use foreign exchange rate derivatives to manage the currency exposure that arises on these loans. It is the Group's policy not to seek to designate these derivatives as hedges.

All derivative financial instruments are classified as derivatives at fair value through the income statement. The Group does not use derivatives for speculative purposes. All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.

Information on the fair value of derivative financial instruments held at the balance sheet date is shown in the table below. Net losses of £1.8m (2022: gains of £3.4m) have been included as part of the foreign exchange losses for the year (note 3).

Fair values are not adjusted for credit risk, as required by IFRS 13, because credit impact is not material given the low fair value levels. All derivative instruments are classified as level 2 instruments.

## Derivative financial instruments

| Derivatives at fair value | 2023<br>£m | 2022<br>£m |
|--------------------------|------------|------------|
| Derivative assets | 1.3 | 3.2 |
| Derivative liabilities | (0.3) | (0.4) |
| Net derivative assets / (liabilities) | 1.0 | 2.8 |

## Sensitivity analysis – currency risk

A 10% strengthening of Sterling against the following currencies at 31 December 2023 would have increased/(decreased) equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This is reflective of the exchange rate movements experienced by the Group over the last 3 years. This analysis is applied currency by currency in isolation, i.e. ignoring the impact of currency correlation, and assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2022. The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected, due to developments in the global financial markets which may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table below, which therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.

| | Equity | | Profit before tax | |
|-|-------|-----|--------------|-----|
| | 2023<br>£'000 | 2022<br>£'000 | 2023<br>£'000 | 2022<br>£'000 |
| Euro | (9,521) | (12,682) | 1,524 | (2,102) |
| Australian Dollar | (1,143) | (1,741) | 735 | (356) |
| Swiss Franc | (411) | (597) | 154 | (76) |
| Chinese Renminbi | (768) | (1,016) | 194 | 169 |
| Hong Kong Dollar | (490) | (720) | 168 | 292 |
| Singapore Dollar | (1,566) | (1,560) | (58) | 274 |
| United States Dollar | (1,847) | (1,741) | (483) | (973) |
| Other | (2,759) | (3,184) | 185 | (246) |

A 10% weakening of Sterling against the above currencies at 31 December would have had a similar but opposite effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
