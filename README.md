# Plan and Overview Document

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the plan and implementation details for the Python Developer Task. The goal of this project is to create an application that takes a user's current mood and city as input, checks if the mood matches the weather in that city, and then recommends a song that matches the user's mood. The system leverages free weather and song recommendation API services.

## 2. Approach to App Development
My approach to app development for this task focused on modularity, readability, and testability. I broke down the application into several distinct components:

*   `WeatherAPI`: Handles interaction with the OpenWeatherMap API.
*   `MoodWeatherMatcher`: Contains the logic for matching user mood with weather conditions.
*   `SongRecommender`: Manages song recommendations using the Last.fm API.
*   `main.py`: Integrates these components using FastAPI to expose an API endpoint.

This modular design allows for easier maintenance, debugging, and potential future expansion. Each component has a clear responsibility, minimizing interdependencies.

## 3. Feature Planning

### Core Features:
*   **Mood Input**: Accept user's current mood (e.g., happy, sad, energetic, relaxed, gloomy).
*   **City Input**: Accept user's city.
*   **Weather API Integration**: Fetch current weather data for the given city using OpenWeatherMap.
*   **Mood-Weather Match Logic**: Determine if the current weather aligns with the user's mood based on predefined mappings.
*   **Song Recommendation API Integration**: Suggest a song matching the entered mood using Last.fm.
*   **API Endpoint**: Provide a RESTful API endpoint using FastAPI to expose the functionality.

### Future Enhancements (Beyond Scope of this Task):
*   **More sophisticated mood-weather mapping**: Implement machine learning or more extensive rule sets for better matching.
*   **Multiple song recommendation sources**: Integrate with other music APIs for a wider range of recommendations.
*   **User authentication and profiles**: Allow users to save preferences and past recommendations.
*   **Frontend UI**: Develop a simple web interface for user interaction.
*   **Error handling improvements**: More granular error messages and logging.
*   **Rate limit handling**: Implement more robust strategies for handling API rate limits.

## 4. Code Quality and Readability
*   **Modularity**: As mentioned, the code is divided into logical units.
*   **Clear Naming**: Variables, functions, and classes are named descriptively to indicate their purpose.
*   **Comments**: Important sections of code are commented to explain complex logic or design choices.
*   **Docstrings**: Functions and classes include docstrings explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.
*   **Consistent Style**: Adhered to PEP 8 guidelines for Python code style.

## 5. Testing Strategy
Unit tests were implemented using `pytest` to ensure the correctness of individual components:
*   `WeatherAPI`: Tested for successful data retrieval and error handling.
*   `MoodWeatherMatcher`: Tested for accurate mood-weather matching and non-matching scenarios.
*   `SongRecommender`: Tested for successful song recommendations, no song found scenarios, and API errors.

Mocking was used for external API calls to ensure tests are fast, reliable, and independent of external service availability.

## 6. Error Handling and Exception Handling
*   **API Request Errors**: `requests.exceptions.RequestException` is caught for network-related issues or invalid responses from external APIs.
*   **HTTP Errors**: `response.raise_for_status()` is used to raise exceptions for bad HTTP responses (4xx or 5xx).
*   **Data Parsing Errors**: Checks are in place to ensure expected keys are present in API responses before accessing them.
*   **FastAPI HTTPException**: Used to return appropriate HTTP status codes and details for API-level errors.

## 7. Dependencies
*   `fastapi`: For building the web API.
*   `uvicorn`: ASGI server to run the FastAPI application.
*   `requests`: For making HTTP requests to external APIs.
*   `pytest`: For unit testing.

These dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## 8. Postman Collection
A Postman collection will be provided to demonstrate the API endpoint and its usage. It will include example requests for different moods and cities.

## 9. Diagrams
No complex diagrams are deemed necessary for this project due to its relatively straightforward architecture. A simple block diagram could illustrate the flow:
