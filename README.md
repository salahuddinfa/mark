## <Overview of Consolidated Profit and Loss (IFRS Basis)>

In the first quarter, consolidated sales revenue was 288.5 billion yen (up 21.8% year-on-year), operating income was 136.7 billion yen (up 36.8% year-on-year), and quarterly profit was 97.2 billion yen (up 30.6% year-on-year). These figures include amortization of intangible assets of 0.4 billion yen, impairment loss on intangible assets of 0.1 billion yen, business restructuring costs of 2.2 billion yen, and costs related to business structure reforms of 0.1 billion yen, which are excluded from the Company’s core performance.


## <Overview of Consolidated Profit and Loss (Core Basis)>

In the first quarter, consolidated sales revenue was 288.5 billion yen (up 21.8% year-on-year), mainly due to an increase in product sales, although other sales revenue decreased.

Of the sales revenue, product sales were 259.7 billion yen (up 27.0% year-on-year). Domestic product sales remained at the same level as the previous year, as the favorable performance of new products such as Fesgo and Piasca and the major product Babysmo was offset by the impact of drug price revisions and the expansion of generic drugs. Overseas product sales significantly increased, driven by a substantial rise in Hemlibra and Actemra exports to Roche. Other sales revenue was 28.7 billion yen (down 11.7% year-on-year), due to an increase in Hemlibra-related income but a decrease in one-time income. The product cost ratio improved to 33.7% (a 1.8 percentage point improvement year-on-year), mainly due to changes in the product sales composition. As a result, gross profit was 201.0 billion yen (up 22.3% year-on-year).

中外製薬株式会社(4519) 2025年12月期 第1四半期決算短信

Research and development expenses were 40.7 billion yen (down 1.2% year-on-year), and selling, general, and administrative expenses were 21.0 billion yen (down 0.9% year-on-year), both similar to the same period last year. Other operating revenues (expenses) were 300 million yen in revenue (2 billion yen in revenue for the same period last year). As a result, Core operating profit was 139.5 billion yen (up 36.6% year-on-year), and Core quarterly profit was 99.2 billion yen (up 30.5% year-on-year).


## ※About Core Performance

The company has been disclosing Core performance since 2013, following the transition to IFRS. Core performance is IFRS performance adjusted for items that the company considers non-recurring. The items considered non-recurring by the company may differ from Roche's judgment due to differences in business scale and scope. The company uses Core performance as an indicator for internal performance management, explaining the trend of ordinary profitability to stakeholders, and for performance-based distribution, including shareholder returns.

For details, please refer to the supplementary materials for the 2025 first quarter consolidated financial results (IFRS) dated April 24, 2025, page 1, "IFRS Performance to Core Performance Adjustment Table".

## [Domestic Product Sales]

Domestic product sales were 103.0 billion yen (down 0.2% year-on-year), as new products and main products grew, but were affected by price revisions and the penetration of generic drugs.

Oncology sales were 53.1 billion yen (down 5.3% year-on-year). Although the new anti-cancer agent/anti-HER2 humanized monoclonal antibody/hyaluronic acid decomposition enzyme combination "Fesgo" had a favorable start, the sales of main products such as anti-cancer agent/anti-VEGF humanized monoclonal antibody "Avastin" decreased due to price revisions and the penetration of generic drugs. Additionally, the anti-cancer agent/anti-HER2 humanized monoclonal antibody "Perjeta" significantly decreased due to the market penetration of "Fesgo".

Specialty sales were 49.9 billion yen (up 6.2% year-on-year). Despite being affected by price revisions and the penetration of generic drugs, the main ophthalmic VEGF/Ang-2 inhibitor anti-VEGF/anti-Ang-2 humanized bispecific monoclonal antibody "Beovu" had a favorable trend, and the new pH-dependent binding humanized anti-complement (C5) monoclonal antibody "Piasky" had a favorable market penetration, and the sales of anti-influenza virus agent "Tamiflu" increased.


## [Overseas Product Sales]

Overseas product sales were 156.7 billion yen (up 54.7% year-on-year). Exports to Roche significantly increased, driven by the blood coagulation factor II functional replacement agent anti-blood coagulation factor Ia/X factor humanized bispecific monoclonal antibody "Hemlibra" and humanized anti-human IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody "Actemra".

## **Research and Development Activities**

During the first quarter of the fiscal year ending December 2025, the Core-based research and development expenses were 40.7 billion yen (a 1.2% decrease compared to the same period of the previous year), and the ratio of research and development expenses to sales revenue was 14.1%.

The progress of research and development activities from January 1, 2025, to March 31, 2025, is as follows:


## **Oncology**

· Anti-malignant tumor agent/anti-PD-L1 humanized monoclonal antibody "RG7446" (product name: "Tecentriq") received approval for expanded indication for unresectable alveolar soft part sarcoma in February 2025.

· Anti-malignant tumor agent/anti-PD-L1 humanized monoclonal antibody "RG7446" (product name: "Tecentriq") discontinued domestic development for prostate cancer [secondary treatment] (in combination with cabozantinib) in light of the results of the phase III international joint clinical trial "CONTACT-02 study". Additionally, development for early breast cancer (perioperative) was discontinued in light of the results of clinical trials conducted so far.

· Anti-TIGIT human monoclonal antibody "RG6058" discontinued development for non-small cell lung cancer [first-line treatment] (in combination with RG7446) in light of the results of the phase III international joint clinical trial "SKYSCRAPER-01 study".

· Anti-HER2/CD3 bispecific antibody "RG6194" discontinued development for solid tumors for strategic reasons.

· Anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) humanized monoclonal antibody "RG435" (product name: "Avastin") discontinued development for small cell lung cancer [first-line treatment] (in combination with RG7446) in light of the results of the phase III clinical trial "BEAT-SC study".

Net Operating Assets (NOA) at the end of the first quarter of 2025 decreased by 18.9 billion yen from the end of the previous fiscal year to 928.7 billion yen. 
This was mainly due to a decrease in net working capital, which was 417 billion yen lower than at the end of the previous fiscal year, at 407 billion yen, 
due to a decrease in receivables from the settlement of royalties and a decrease in inventories. 
Long-term net operating assets increased by 22.8 billion yen from the end of the previous fiscal year to 521.7 billion yen, 
mainly due to investments in the biopharmaceutical manufacturing building (UT3) and the injection building (UTA) at the Utsunomiya factory.

As shown in the next section, "Cash Flow Situation," net cash, including securities and interest-bearing debt, decreased by 51.7 billion yen from the end of the previous fiscal year to 944.6 billion yen. 
Other net non-operating assets increased by 76.4 billion yen from the end of the previous fiscal year to 33.9 billion yen, 
mainly due to a decrease in accrued corporate income tax.

As a result, total net assets increased by 5.7 billion yen from the end of the previous fiscal year to 1,907.2 billion yen.


##### ※About Net Operating Assets (NOA) and Net Assets

The consolidated statement of financial position is prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 1 "Presentation of Financial Statements." 
On the other hand, Net Operating Assets (NOA) and Net Assets are reconfigured from the consolidated statement of financial position as an internal management indicator, 
and Roche also discloses similar indicators. 
Note that there are no exclusion items like Core performance.

For details, please refer to the supplementary materials P. 8 "Financial Position." 


##### ※About Net Operating Assets (NOA)

Net Operating Assets (NOA) enable the evaluation of the Company's group performance independently of financial transactions and tax transactions. 
Net Operating Assets are calculated by deducting provisions from net working capital and long-term net operating assets, 
including tangible fixed assets, right-of-use assets, intangible assets, etc.

Adjusted operating income, which is operating income adjusted for all non-cash profit and loss items, including depreciation, and all non-profit and loss cash inflows and outflows related to net operating assets, was ¥146.2 billion (up 35.1% year on year).

From adjusted operating income, we had outflows of ¥22.0 billion for acquisition of tangible fixed assets, while we had a decrease in net working capital of ¥40.8 billion, resulting in an operating free cash flow of ¥162.4 billion (up 17.8% year on year). The factors for the decrease in net working capital are described in the previous section "Assets, Liabilities, and Net Assets."

From operating free cash flow, we paid ¥106.9 billion in corporate income tax, resulting in a free cash flow of ¥42.7 billion (down 51.0% year on year).

After adjusting for the payment of dividends of ¥93.4 billion from free cash flow, the net change in cash was a decrease of ¥51.7 billion.

Excluding increases and decreases in securities and interest-bearing debt, cash and cash equivalents decreased by ¥116.8 billion, resulting in a quarter-end balance of ¥423.4 billion.

*   About Free Cash Flow (FCF)

The consolidated cash flow statement is prepared based on International Accounting Standard 7 "Statement of Cash Flows." On the other hand, FCF is a reconfiguration of the consolidated cash flow statement as an internal management indicator, and Roche also discloses a similar indicator. Note that FCF does not have any exclusions like Core actual.

For details, please refer to the supplementary materials, page 9, "Cash Flow."

### Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (4519) 
### Quarterly Financial Report for the First Quarter of the Fiscal Year Ending December 2025


#### (5) Notes on Going Concern

There are no relevant matters.


#### (6) Notes on Summary Quarterly Consolidated Financial Statements


#### 1 Significant Accounting Policies


##### (a) Basis of Preparation

These summary quarterly consolidated financial statements are those of Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., a company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (stock code: 4519) and located in Tokyo, Japan, and its subsidiaries. These summary quarterly consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on April 24, 2025.

Roche Holding Ltd. is a parent company of the Roche Group, which is listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange and reports its results in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Our Group has been a major member of the Roche Group since October 2002, following the conclusion of a strategic alliance with Roche. Roche Holding Ltd. owns 59.89% of our outstanding shares (61.11% if treasury shares are excluded).

Our Group prepares its summary quarterly consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards for quarterly financial statements, etc. of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Article 5, paragraph 2 (however, some disclosures required by IAS 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" have been omitted based on Article 5, paragraph 5). 

These summary quarterly consolidated financial statements do not include all the information required for annual consolidated financial statements; therefore, they should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the previous fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.

The summary quarterly consolidated financial statements are presented in Japanese yen, which is our functional currency, and amounts of less than one million yen have been rounded off.

Except for certain items measured at fair value, measurements are based on historical cost.


#### (b) Significant Accounting Judgments, Estimates, and Assumptions

The preparation of our summary quarterly consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingent events. These estimates may differ from actual results. Estimates and underlying assumptions are based on past experience and various factors and are continuously reviewed. Changes in estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the change occurs.

The information on judgments, estimates, and assumptions that have a significant impact on the amounts recognized in our summary quarterly consolidated financial statements is, in principle, the same as that for the previous fiscal year.


#### (c) Changes in Accounting Policies

The significant accounting policies applied to our summary quarterly consolidated financial statements are the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the previous fiscal year.

There were minor changes in some standards, but they did not have a significant impact on our results or financial position.
