# Notes to the Financial Statements\n\n\n## 1. General Information\n\n\n### a) Reporting entity\n\nBloomsbury Publishing Plc (the "Company") is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales and domiciled in the United\nKingdom. The address of the Company\'s registered office can be found on page 212. The consolidated financial statements of the\nCompany as at and for the year ended 28 February 2025 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").\nThe Group is primarily involved in the publication of books and other related services.\n\n\n### b) Statement of compliance\n\nThe Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with UK-adopted international\naccounting standards ("IFRS") and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\n\n### c) Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis (see Note 1d) and under the historical cost convention\nas modified by the revaluation of financial assets and liabilities at fair value.\n\nThis year, we have adopted a rounding practice to present current and prior year figures in millions instead of thousands. This change aims\nto enhance the clarity and usability of our financial statements.\n\nThese consolidated financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 21 May 2025.\n\n\n### d) Going concern\n\nThe Group\'s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out\nin the Strategic Report on pages 10 to 90. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position are described in the\nFinancial Review on pages 30 to 34. In addition, Note 24 to the financial statements includes the Group\'s objectives, policies and processes\nfor managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments, and its exposures to credit risk and\nliquidity risk.\n\nThe Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence at least 12 months\nfrom the date of approval of the financial statements, being the period of the detailed going concern assessment reviewed by the Board,\nand, therefore, continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Board has modelled a severe but plausible downside scenario. This assumes that:\n\n· print revenues are reduced by 20% during 2025/2026 with recovery during 2026/2027;\n\n· digital revenues are reduced by 20% during 2025/2026 with recovery during 2026/2027;\n\n· print costs are increased by 2% from 2025/2026 and staff costs are increased by 2% from 2026/2027;\n\n· downside assumptions about extended debtor days during 2025/2026, with recovery during 2026/2027; and\n\n. cash preservation measures are implemented, and variable costs are reduced.\n\nAt 28 February 2025, the Group had available liquidity of £60.6m, comprising central cash balances and its undrawn £20m Revolving Credit\nFacility ("RCF"). The RCF agreement is to November 2027. Under the severe but plausible downside scenario, the Group would maintain\nsufficient liquidity headroom even before modelling the mitigating effect of actions that management would take in the event that these\ndownside risks were to crystallise. Details of the bank facility and its covenants are shown in Note 24c).\n\n\n### e) Use of estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and\nassumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual\nresults may differ from these estimates.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in\nwhich the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. Critical judgements and areas where the use of estimates is significant are\ndisclosed in Note 2s).\n\nBloomsbury Publishing Plc\n154\nwww.bloomsbury.com\n
