## Note 1 Material accounting policies


### Statement of compliance

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the EU.
Swedish Corporate Reporting Board recommendation RFR 1
Supplementary Accounting Rules for Corporate Groups has also been
applied.

The parent company applies the same accounting policies as the Group,
except in the cases stated below under the "Parent company accounting
policies" section.

The parent company's annual accounts and the consolidated accounts
were approved for issue by the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive
Officer on 11 April 2024. The consolidated income statement and balance
sheet and the parent company's income statement and balance sheet will
be subject to adoption by the Annual General Meeting on 25 May 2024.
The consolidated and annual accounts refer to 1 January-31 December for
income statement-related items and 31 December for balance sheet-
related items. All amounts are provided in millions of Swedish kronor (SEK)
unless otherwise stated, and rounding differences may therefore occur.


### Valuation policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements

Assets and liabilities are recognised at historical cost, except for certain
financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. Financial
assets and liabilities measured at fair value consist of investments in
associates and contingent considerations. Receivables and liabilities and
income and expenses are only offset if required or explicitly authorised by
an accounting standard.

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRS
requires the corporate executive to make certain assessments, estimates
and assumptions in applying the Group's accounting policies and balance
sheet and income statement items. The areas that include a high degree of
assessment, which are complex, or areas where assumptions and
estimates are of significant importance for the consolidated financial
statements are set out in Note 2.

Events after the balance sheet date refer both to events occurring between
the balance sheet date and to the date on which the financial statements
are signed by the directors. Disclosures are made in the annual report
about significant events after the balance sheet date that have not been
taken into account in preparing the balance sheet and income statement.
Only those events that confirm conditions existing at the balance sheet
date are taken into account when finalising the accounts. Unless otherwise
stated, the most significant accounting policies set out below have been
applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated financial
statements.


### Standards, amendments and interpretations that came into force in 2023

In 2023, amendments have been adopted in respect of IAS 1 Presentation
of Financial Statements and IAS 12 Deferred Tax Assets and Deferred Tax
Liabilities. The amendment affects the consolidated report insofar as only
accounting policies that are considered material to the Group are to be
disclosed.


### New standards and interpretations not yet in force

Other amended IFRSs that will become effective in future financial years or
later have not been applied early in the preparation of this year's financial
statements. The new standards and interpretations are not expected to
have any significant impact on Sdiptech's financial reporting.


### Non-controlling interests

Non-controlling interests are recognised as a separate item in
consolidated equity.

Acquisitions from non-controlling interests are recognised as an equity
transaction, i.e. between the owners of the parent company and the non-
controlling interest. Therefore, goodwill does not arise in these
transactions.


### Translation of foreign currency

Functional currency and reporting currency
Items included in the financial statements of the various entities in the
Group are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (functional currency). The
consolidated financial statements use the Swedish krona (SEK), which is
the functional and reporting currency of the parent company. All amounts
are in SEK million unless otherwise stated.


### Transactions and balance sheet items

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at
the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. The functional
currency is the currency of the primary economic sectors in which Group
companies operate. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies
are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate in force on
the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from
translation are recognised in the income statement. Exchange rate
differences on lending and borrowing are recognised in net financial items,
while other exchange rate differences are included in operating profit. Non-
monetary assets and liabilities recognised at historical cost are translated
at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the transaction. Non-
monetary assets and liabilities that are recognised at fair value are
converted to the functional currency at the rate in effect at the time of the
fair value valuation.


### Group companies

The earnings and financial position of all Group companies with a functional
currency other than the reporting currency are translated into the reporting
currency of the Group as follows:

. Assets and liabilities for each of the balance sheets of foreign operations
are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses for each of the income statements of foreign
operations are translated at the average exchange rate.

### Note 1, cont.

. All resulting exchange rate differences are recognised as a separate
component of equity in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a
foreign operation, in whole or in part, the exchange differences
recognised in equity are taken to the income statement and recognised
as part of the capital gain/loss.

. Goodwill and adjustments to fair value arising on the acquisition of a
foreign company are treated as assets and liabilities in this company and
translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.


### Cash flow statement

The cash flow statement is prepared using the indirect method. The
reported cash flow includes only transactions involving payments in or out.
Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement are consistent with
the definition of cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet.


### Materials and general subcontract work

Materials and general subcontract work refer to the direct costs of the
goods or services supplied.


### Parent company accounting policies

The parent company's annual report has been prepared in accordance
with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act (ARL 1995:1554) and RFR 2
Accounting for Legal Entities. Under RFR 2, the parent company in the
annual accounts of the legal entity must apply all of the EU-approved IFRS
standards and statements provided this is possible within the framework of
the Swedish Company Accounts Act and with due regard for the
relationship between accounting and taxes. This recommendation
specifies which exceptions and additions must be applied with regard to
IFRS.

Changes to accounting policies

Unless otherwise stated below, the parent company's accounting policies
in 2023 have been changed in accordance with what is stated above for
the Group.


### Classification and valuation

The parent company's income statement and balance sheet are presented
in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act. The main
differences between this and IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements as
applied to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements relate to
the presentation of financial income and expenses, fixed assets, equity and
the presentation of provisions under a separate heading in the balance
sheet.


### Group contributions and shareholder contributions

Group contributions received and paid in the parent company are
recognised as appropriations. Shareholders' contributions are recognised
directly in the equity of the recipient and as an investment in shares in
subsidiaries or, if no value is added, as an impairment of the shares through
the income statement.


### Difference between the Group's and the parent company's accounting policies

The parent company does not apply IFRS 16 Leases under the exemption
in RFR 2. The parent company's rental agreements are recognised as
operating leases.

The parent company has chosen not to apply IFRS 9 for financial
instruments. However, some of the policies in IFRS 9 are still applicable,
such as those relating to impairment. In the parent company, financial
assets are valued at cost less any impairment, and current financial assets
are valued according to the lowest value principle.

No significant differences have been noted in respect of new standards
and interpretations that have not yet come into force.

The parent company uses the formats specified in the Annual Accounts
Act, which means that a different presentation of equity is applied. The
parent company has different titles for the accounts compared to the
Group.

Participations in subsidiaries are reported in the parent company in
accordance with the cost method. This means that transaction costs are
included in the carrying amount of investments in subsidiaries and
associates. Transaction costs relating to shares in Group companies are
recognised directly in the income statement.

Dividends from subsidiaries are fully recognised as income in the income
statement.


## Note 2 Significant estimates and assessments when applying the Group's accounting policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and IFRS
requires the corporate executive and the Board of Directors to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of income
and expenses, assets and liabilities and other disclosures.

Estimates and assessments are evaluated regularly and are based on
historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future
events that are considered reasonable under the prevailing circumstances.
The actual amounts may differ from estimates made. The areas where
estimates and assumptions that are considered to be significant to the
understanding of the financial statements are discussed in the following
section on the basis of the significance of assessments and uncertainty.
The conditions for the Group are gradually changing, which means that
these assessments will change.


### Impairment testing of goodwill

The Group Executive Board tests goodwill for impairment at least annually
in accordance with the accounting policies described under "Impairment
testing of other fixed assets".

Goodwill is monitored within the Group's operating segments, which in turn
consist of groups of cash-generating entities. The Group Executive Board
constantly monitors developments in the cash-generating entities. The
cash-generating entity to which goodwill has been allocated must be
valued by discounting the entity's cash flows in order to determine whether
the value of goodwill has been impaired. Sdiptech performs the impairment
test on the basis of the grouping of the cash-generating entities in the
Group's operating segments, which is the lowest level of internal monitoring
of financial position.

In applying this methodology, the Group Executive Board relies on a
number of factors including historical performance, strategic plans and
forecasts and market data. A more detailed description of the methodology
can be found in Note 12 Goodwill.


### Impairment testing of other fixed assets

The Group's tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are stated
at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Apart
from goodwill, no intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are
recognised. They are amortised over their estimated useful life at an
estimated residual value. Both useful life and residual value are reviewed at
the end of each accounting period, as a minimum.

The carrying amount of the Group's non-current assets is reviewed
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of intangible assets
not yet ready for use is tested annually. The recoverable amount of the
asset is determined if such an analysis indicates an overstated carrying
amount.

The recoverable amount is the fair value of an asset less costs to sell or its
value in use, whichever is the higher. Value in use is calculated as the
expected future discounted cash flow from the asset, or the cash-
generating entity to which the asset belongs. A test of the carrying amount
also arises when a fixed asset is classified as held for sale, when it is
recognised at its carrying amount or its fair value less costs to sell,
whichever is the lower.


### Assumptions when calculating lease liability

When calculating lease liability, the corporate executive has made a
number of estimates, assumptions and assessments that, if made
differently, would affect the amount of the lease liability. Discounting at a
marginal rate in cases where a fixed rate is not stated in the underlying
contract is a parameter of greater importance. The discount rate affects

#### Note 2, cont.

the size of the liability and right-of-use asset, as well as interest expense
and depreciation, and thus a different assessment of the incremental
discount rate would have an impact on the measurement of the lease
liability. The assessment of extension options is another aspect that is
significantly affected by assessment. The Group assesses the probability
that extension options will only be exercised when it is reasonably certain
that the contract will be extended given a number of parameters relating to
investments in premises and the company's growth: see Note 15 Right-of-
use assets.


#### Valuation of acquisition-related liabilities

In the business combinations conducted by Sdiptech, part of the purchase
price is normally linked to the acquired company's financial performance
during a given period of time after closing. The book value of the liabilities to
the sellers in the form of contingent considerations is based on the same
factors as for impairment testing of goodwill, including - but not limited to -
historical performance, strategic plans and forecasts and market data. The
time period for the assessment differs from impairment testing of goodwill
in that only the fixed period of time that constitutes the remainder of the
contingent consideration for each acquisition is included. The Group's
earnings can thus be affected both positively and negatively as a result of
the assessments made by the Group Executive Board of each company's
financial results during the remaining part of the conditional period.


## Note 3 Business acquisitions


### Accounting policies

Acquired companies are accounted for using the acquisition method and
are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on
which control of the company is acquired. Accordingly, the sum of the
consideration paid, including contingent consideration, and the acquired
company's identifiable net assets are measured at fair value at the
acquisition date. When a subsidiary is acquired and previous owners
remain as minority owners, the agreement in some cases contains an
option that gives the minority owner the right to sell the remaining holdings
\- and Sdiptech the opportunity to buy - at a later stage. No non-controlling
interest is recognised in these cases: a financial liability is recognised
instead. The liability is recognised as a contingent consideration at the
present value of the redemption amount for the shares. Transaction costs
related to acquisitions are expensed as incurred under other external
costs.

The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group's
percentage of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities
acquired is recognised as goodwill and is tested for impairment at least
annually.

The pre-acquisition analysis is preliminary and is kept open for 12 months
from the closing date. During the period, adjustments can be made to the
preliminary amounts recognised at the time of acquisition, e.g. adjustments
linked to the determination of the access balance and the outcome of
guarantees in the acquisition agreement.


### Accounting for acquisitions

The estimated purchase price for the operations acquired during the
financial year totalled SEK 491.9 (1,754.1) million. This amount includes an
estimated contingent consideration of SEK 84.6 (476.9) million. The
outcome of the contingent consideration is dependent on the net profit
generated by the companies from the time of acquisition until the end of the
contingent consideration period: the reference point for growth is
calculated on normalised annual profit at the time of acquisition. The
contingent consideration is initially measured at the present value of the
probable outcome. This year's acquisition runs over 4 to 6 years and the
outcome can be a maximum of SEK 189 (456) million. The outcome can be
within the range of SEK 0-189 (0-456) million unless all the conditions are
met. The exception is the acquisition of the outstanding shares in
HeatWork, which are subject to current redemption agreements by a
multiple which varies in turn according to growth in relation to the reference
net profit.

As a result of acquisitions during the financial year, goodwill in the Group
has increased by SEK 295.2 (962.4) million and other intangible assets by
SEK 142.7 (407.4) million.

The effect of the completed acquisitions on consolidated turnover during
the financial year is SEK 142.0 (525.8) million, and SEK 37.6 (134.4) million
on profit excluding acquisition costs before tax.

During the year, SEK 185.8 (356.1) million of contingent consideration was
paid in respect of 9 acquisitions from previous years, of which three relate
to final settlement of the contingent consideration and the remainder,
according to agreement, early partial settlement of part of the contingent
consideration.


#### Acquired intangible assets

When preparing acquisition analyses, it is investigated whether there are
any differences between the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities
and the values recognised in the accounts of the acquired company. The
analysis examines the existence of:

· IP rights (technology-related), such as patents and licence rights

· trademarks

· customer relations

A review of contingent liabilities and tax loss carryforwards is also included.

Assets that fulfil the requirements of separability and measurability have
been identified in the companies acquired during the year.

##### Note 3, cont.

Goodwill consists of the amount by which the consolidated cost of shares
in acquired subsidiaries exceeds the fair value of the company's net assets
recognised in the acquisition analysis at the time of acquisition, and is
mainly attributable to synergies and other intangible assets that do not
meet the criteria for separate recognition. Goodwill relates to the expected
contribution of the acquired entity to complement and broaden the Group's
offering, sales channels and synergies in infrastructure and contribute to
the Group's continued growth.

The values allocated to intangible assets relating to the year's acquisitions
are:

· IP rights SEK 27.5 (42.6) million

· Brands and trademarks SEK 43.3 (84.2) million

. Customer relations SEK 71.9 (280.6) million

The amortisation period is assessed by asset and acquisition. Annual
estimated amortisation of intangible assets for the year's acquisitions
amounts to around SEK 9 (27) million.

Acquisition-related expenses, known as transaction costs, are expensed
as incurred. External advisors have been used to a limited extent, primarily
for commercial, legal and financial due diligence, as the Group has an
internal acquisition team that works with acquisitions on an ongoing basis.

Transaction costs for the year amount to SEK 13.4 (20.7) million.


###### Acquisitions during the year

The Group's business model involves an active search for additional
solutions to critical needs in the infrastructure sector, and the purpose of
the Group's acquisitions is to expand the presence and the Group's offering
in the Group's operating segments.

A total of 2 business acquisitions were made during the financial year.


####### HeatWork AS

On 31 March 2023, Sdiptech acquired 81.6 per cent of shares in HeatWork
AS, with subsidiaries in Sweden and Finland. HeatWork has 20 years of
experience of development of specialised hydronic heating products. Its
mobile heating plants are specially designed to meet the needs of many
applications, such as energy production, agriculture and horticulture, pest
control, construction, emergency response and municipal water
protection. HeatWork focuses strongly on innovative, sustainable and
qualitative solutions, and the technology helps to make a significant
reduction in energy consumption, cost and CO2 emissions. The company
has an annual turnover of NOK 120 million with good profitability, with an
annual operating profit of about NOK 23 million at the time of acquisition.

HeatWork operates globally, with a head office and production facilities in
Narvik in Norway, and is a strong addition to the Group in respect of energy
solutions. This company is Sdiptech's second business entity in Norway.
HeatWork has 42 employees at the time of acquisition.

At the transaction date, the company is valued at NOK 225 million on a
cash- and debt-free basis. Financing is provided by own resources and
bank credits. The final purchase price, including the redemption under
option of the remaining 18.4 per cent of the company's shares, is dependent
on the company's performance during the earn-out period. Under the
agreement, Sdiptech can buy the remaining shares after 6 years, with the
valuation of the remaining shares depending on the company's profit
growth. At the time of acquisition, the value of the remaining shares is
estimated to amount to SEK 46 million after present value calculation. The
company is part of the Resource Efficiency business area.


######## Kemi-tech AS

Sdiptech acquired all shares in Kemi-tech A/S on 11 July 2023. Based in
Hedensted in Denmark, Kemi-tech is a leading supplier of custom chemical
products for industrial water treatment and specialises in chemical
treatment of all types of water-bearing systems. The company's products
ensure that steam boilers, cooling systems and district heating plants
operate more efficiently, save energy and extend their service life. The
company has an annual turnover of DKK 34 million, with an annual
operating profit of around DKK 16 million at the time of acquisition. This
company is Sdiptech's second business entity in Denmark, and its strong
track record in the field of environmental solutions is an addition to
Sdiptech's efforts to deliver sustainable and innovative technologies
supported by long-term growth trends.

At the transaction date, the company is valued at DKK 146 million on a cash-
and debt-free basis. Financing is provided by own resources and bank
credits. The final purchase price including earn-out costs, settled after the
earn-out period ending in July 2027, will be between GBP 146 and 196
million, depending on the company's performance during the earn-out
period. A final total purchase price higher than the current value of DKK 146
million assumes a higher than current level of earnings. Kemi-tech has 15
employees at the time of acquisition.

The estimated contingent consideration for Kemi-tech amounts to SEK 38
million at the time of acquisition, after present value calculation. The
assessment is made on the basis of an assessment of the likely outcome
based on forecasts for the company, from the time of acquisition until the
end of the period for the contingent consideration. Kemi-tech is part of the
Resource Efficiency business area.

Preliminary acquisition analyses were adjusted by SEK 21.6 (-13.4) million
during the financial year, which refers to final access balances and net cash
adjustments for Patol Ltd and Mecno Srl, which increased the Group's
goodwill by SEK 21.6 million.


### Valuation technique for contingent considerations

The executive team makes an assessment of the recognised contingent
consideration at each reporting period after the acquisition date. The
valuation is based on an assessment of historical results, strategic plans
and forecasts, as well as market data and other known information,
financial and non-financial, that is deemed to be capable of affecting the
contingent consideration. Information that is deemed to materially affect
the contingent consideration-regardless of whether this relates to the
impact of the macro or micro environment - is also included. A general
growth rate of 6 per cent is assumed for the remaining term in cases where
the contingent consideration extends beyond the established budget and
strategic plan, which normally covers three years from the balance sheet
date.

#### Note 3, cont.

The revaluation of the contingent considerations can occur both upwards -
i.e. with an increase in the liability, driven by higher future estimated earnings
in previous years' acquired entities - as well as downwards. The adjustment
is recognised in the income statement under other income in the event of a
decrease in the liability, and under other external charges in the event of an
increase. Revaluation is carried out annually at the end of the financial year
after the companies' strategic plan for the following year has been adopted,
unless the conditions for any entity have changed significantly: this could
require a revaluation during the current financial year. The total contingent
consideration for the Group is discounted at a total level during the financial
year, and at the end of the financial year is reversed to a present value
calculation and discounting of the liability for future payments per
acquisition.

The discount rate used in the assessment has been adjusted during the
financial year from three to four percentage points, which for the full year,
given the closing debt, resulted in a reduction in the debt of SEK 26.9 (35.4)
million. The adjustment of the discount rate occurs when the Group's
borrowing rate has increased, on account of the increase in the policy rate.


##### Acquisition analyses 2022

A total of 7 business acquisitions were made during the financial year.

Sdiptech AB (publ) acquired all shares in Agrosistemi Srl on 31 January
2022. This company specialises in the treatment and recycling of biological
sludge resulting from wastewater treatment and has over 20 years of
experience. Located in Piacenza, Italy, the company has developed a
patented treatment process used to remove harmful substances from
sludge and convert it into high quality organic fertiliser products.
Agrosistemi has an annual turnover of EUR 8.5 million, with EUR 2.0 million

## Note 4 Segment reporting


### Accounting policies

The Group's segment reporting is based on the operating segments that
reflect the Group's management structure and how financial information is
regularly reviewed by Sdiptech's chief operating decision maker, who is
responsible for allocating resources and evaluating the performance of the
operating segments. This has been identified as the Group Executive Board
at Sdiptech.

The Group Executive Board monitors the performance of the organisation
and makes decisions on the allocation of resources. Sdiptech's acquisition
organisation maps markets and value chains in depth in the Group's
selected business areas. Acquisition decisions and operational decisions
are made and governance, control and follow-up are performed by the
Group Executive Board through the respective Business Area Manager,
with the support of other central functions. Companies within a given
business area often have common customers, suppliers and market
dynamics. This leads to potential revenue synergies (cross-selling, joint
tenders for complex projects, etc.) and corresponding potential cost
synergies (joint procurement, larger volume contracts with suppliers, etc.).
The expertise within each company in the business area also creates
synergies.

The Group's operations are organisationally divided into two business
areas, Resource Efficiency and Special Infrastructure Solutions.

Under IFRS, the part of the business that does not constitute separate
operating segments is referred to as Other segments. At Sdiptech,
unallocated items known as central costs arising in the Group's holding
company are included in this concept and consist of overheads for the
Group's parent company, interest and dividend income, interest expenses,
tax expenses, certain administrative expenses, etc.

Operating segments are monitored on net sales, which include external and
internal sales. Transactions between operational entities are based on the
arm's length principle and are eliminated on consolidation. Internal sales
between business areas are very limited and of non-material amounts, as
shown in the elimination column in the table below. Adjusted EBITA is the
Group's performance measure (see Definitions of key figures and
explanations).

Segment information is provided for the Group only, in accordance with
IFRS 8.


### Resource Efficiency

Companies within Resource Efficiency provide niche products and services
that help to bring about efficient and sustainable use of resources such as
water, energy, minerals, forests and food.

## Note 5 Earnings


### Accounting policies


#### Sale of products

Sdiptech's revenues consist predominantly of sales of goods that are
recognised as revenue at a certain point in time. Revenue is recognised
when the Group fulfils a performance obligation, which is the time when a
promised product or service is delivered to the customer and the customer
takes control of the product or service. Control is found to pass to the
customer when the following indicators are regarded as being met, but is
not limited to these: the customer is in physical possession, the company is
contractually entitled to payment, the customer has accepted the
goods/services, significant risks and rewards have passed to the
customer, or legal title has passed to the customer. In the sale of goods,
control usually passes to the customer when significant risks and benefits
have been transferred, which is normally regulated by Incoterms. In the
case of the sale of services, control usually passes to the customer once
the customer has accepted the service provided. Revenue is measured on
the basis of the consideration specified in the contract with the customer.


#### Installation

Some contracts include services such as the installation of a product.
Assignments are deemed to constitute a combined performance obligation
unless each product is distinctly separate within the framework of the
contracts. The transaction price normally consists of fixed amounts. If it is
anticipated that the assignment will result in a loss, the loss is then
immediately recognised in the income statement.


#### Service

The Group also has a percentage of revenue from service and maintenance
contracts. This revenue is recognised either directly if it relates to a separate
delivery of a service or on a straight-line basis over the contract period if it
relates to an ongoing service over a period.


#### Revenue recognition over time

The Group also recognises revenue from major projects where the
company's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use for
the company and the company is entitled to payment for work performed to
date. These revenues are recognised over time. Revenue is recognised on
an ongoing basis in an amount that represents the value transferred to the
customer and that the company is entitled to invoice on an ongoing basis.
Most of Sdiptech's revenue is recognised at one point in time. Increases or
decreases in estimated revenues or expenses resulting from a change in
estimate are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the
circumstances became known.

In fixed price contracts, the client pays the agreed price at agreed payment
times. A contract asset is recognised if the products/services delivered
exceed the payment. If the payments exceed the services delivered, a
contractual liability is recognised.

Variable payments such as discounts, credits, returns or similar are
recognised on the basis of the probability of whether or not a significant
reversal will occur using the expected value method or the most likely value
method.

Guarantees exist and are predominantly of the "assurance" type, i.e. the
guarantee does not constitute a separate performance obligation and
therefore does not affect revenue recognition, but is recognised as an
expense or provision. The right of return for customers exists only to a very
limited extent in the Group.

The Group applies the relief rule of not capitalising costs to obtain contracts
with customers, unless the contract extends beyond 12 months. The Group
has no material assets arising from costs incurred to fulfil a contract, such as
costs of obtaining contracts with customers, pre-contractual expenses and
start-up costs.

No one customer accounts for more than 10 per cent of the Group's total
turnover.

Payment terms within the Group vary between 30 and 120 days, with an
average of 57 (62) days.

## Contractual assets and liabilities

The Group recognises the following assets and liabilities in the balance
sheet related to contracts with customers.


<table>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>2023</th>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Accounts receivable</td>
<td>827.3</td>

<tr>

<td>906.6</td>
<td>693.0</td>

</table>


Accrued income refers to the portion of income where performance
obligations have been met but the invoice has been issued after the end of
the period. Prepaid income refers to income that has been invoiced for a
future period and where the income is recognised as the performance
obligation is fulfilled, which includes service agreements.

The Group's order backlog runs over shorter periods on average and, as of
the balance sheet date, the Group has order backlogs of around SEK 100
million extending over 12 months. As a result, the Group does not adjust the
transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component.


## Note 6 Other operating income

Government grants are reported in the Balance Sheet as prepaid income
when there is a reasonable assurance that the funding will be received and
that the company will meet the conditions attached to the funding.
Government grants related to assets are recognised as a deduction of the
grant from the carrying amount of the asset.

## Note 7 Remuneration to employees


### Accounting policies

Salaries, social security contributions, bonuses and other short-term employee benefits are recognised as an expense when the employee has rendered
the service. On termination, a liability and an expense are recognised if it is likely that the offer will be taken up and a reliable estimate can be made. The
Group's pension plans are essentially defined contribution plans for which insurance premiums are paid, and employees bear the risk in respect of the
future pension level.

### Preparation and decision-making process in respect of remuneration to the Board of Directors, the CEO and the Group Executive Board

The guidelines that were applicable during the 2023 financial year for
remuneration to senior executives were adopted at the 2023 Annual
General Meeting and essentially correspond to the guidelines presented in
the proposal for future years. The principle for remuneration to the Board of
Directors, the CEO and the Group Executive Board is that this should be
competitive.

The Nomination Committee submits a proposal to the Annual General
Meeting regarding remuneration for the Board of Directors. Remuneration
to the Board of Directors is paid as decided by the Annual General Meeting.
With regard to remuneration to the CEO, the Group Executive Board and
other senior Group executives, the Board of Directors has appointed a
Remuneration Committee comprising the Chairman of the Board of
Directors and one of the members of the Board of Directors, with the CEO
as rapporteur. The CEO, Group Executive Board and other senior
executives receive a fixed salary, variable remuneration and normal
employment benefits. There are also pension benefits and incentive
programmes as described below. The Remuneration Committee considers
the guidelines on remuneration for senior executives as adopted by the
Annual General Meeting of Sdiptech AB.


### Long-term incentive schemes

The purpose of the incentive programmes, and the reason for deviating
from the shareholders' preferential rights, is to create conditions for
retaining and recruiting talented staff to the Group, to increase participants'
motivation, encourage loyalty to the company and alignment with the
company's shareholders, and to promote personal share ownership in the
company and thereby promote shareholder value and the company's long-
term value creation.

At an Extraordinary General Meeting on 5 March 2018 in Stockholm, it was
unanimously decided in accordance with the Board's proposal to
implement an incentive programme through the issue of warrants and
approval of the transfer of warrants. The incentive programme was aimed
at employees of the parent company. There are no requirements for
continued employment associated with the programme. With deviation
from the shareholders' preferential rights, the warrants are subscribed for
by a wholly owned subsidiary with the right and obligation for the subsidiary
to transfer the warrants to participants in the incentive programme.

The programme included 756,000 warrants divided into three series:
252,000 series 2018/2021 warrants, 252,000 series 2018/2022 warrants
and 252,000 series 2018/2023 warrants. The purchase price for shares on
exercising the option was calculated as corresponding to 120 per cent of
the volume-weighted average of the price paid for the Company's class B
share on NASDAQ Stockholm during a specified period in 2018, where the
premium for the call options has to correspond to the market value of the
call options according to an external independent valuation in accordance
with the Black & Scholes model. Series 2018/2021 was redeemed in March
2021 and newly issued shares were subscribed for, whereby the Group
received SEK 13.3 million in equity. Series 2018/2022 was redeemed in
March 2022 and newly issued shares were subscribed for, whereby the
Group received SEK 14.5 million in equity. Series 2018/2023 was
redeemed in March 2023 and newly issued shares were subscribed for,
whereby the Group received SEK 14.4 million in equity.

The 2021 Annual General Meeting decided on a new incentive programme
of Series B warrants for managers and senior executives. This programme
comprises 350,000 warrants. The exercise price was set at 126 per cent of
the volume-weighted average price paid for Sdiptech's class B share for
the period from 19 May 2021 up to and including 1 June 2021, where the
premium for the call options has to correspond to the market value of the
call options according to an external independent valuation in accordance
with the Black & Scholes model. It can be redeemed on three occasions
from June 2024 until 30 November 2024.

The 2023 Annual General Meeting decided on a new incentive programme
of Series B warrants for managers and senior executives. This programme
comprises 350,000 warrants. The exercise price was set at 126 per cent of
the average share price during the measurement period from 23 May 2023
to 5 June 2023, where the premium for the call options has to correspond
to the market value of the call options according to an external independent
valuation in accordance with the Black & Scholes model. It can be
redeemed on three occasions from June 2026 until 30 November 2026.

Upon full exercise of all outstanding warrants, the increase in the
company's share capital will amount to a maximum of SEK 17,500 relating
to series 2021/2024 and 2023/2026, corresponding to a dilution of a
maximum of around 1.8 per cent of shares and around 1.3 per cent of votes.

## Note 9 Financial income and financial expenses


### Financial income and expenses

Financial income consists mainly of interest income on bank deposits and dividends from associated companies.

Financial expenses consist of interest expenses to credit institutions and discount rates for lease liabilities and
contingent considerations. The contingent considerations are classified as interest-bearing when they are
measured at present value, but they do not give rise to any actual interest payments that affect the Group's cash
flow. Financial income consists mainly of interest income on bank deposits and dividends from associated
companies.

Financial items also include realised and unrealised translation differences on internal and external loans in foreign
currency, as well as currency futures and currency interest rate futures in GBP, EUR and NOK. The Other financial
expenses item includes costs related to borrowing.

Interest received amounts to SEK 4.7 (1.5) million. All interest income relates to financial assets measured at
amortised cost. Interest paid amounts to SEK 159.6 (73.3) million. Interest expenses are attributable to both
financial liabilities measured at amortised cost and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss

## Note 10 Taxes


### Accounting policies

Deferred tax assets are recognised insofar as it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which
the temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised. In the Group, only significant deferred tax assets are held
by the parent company.

Sdiptech AB's capital assets in the form of shares in subsidiaries and associated companies constitute what are
known as business interests, according to the definition in Chapter 24 (13) to (16) of the Income Tax Act. As a
general rule, a capital gain on the disposal of business interests is tax-free. At the same time, the general rule is that
capital losses on business interests are not deductible. Tax losses are recognised as deferred tax assets in the
balance sheet. The Group has capitalised tax losses in the balance sheet to a value of around SEK 25 million before
tax. Most of the losses relate to the parent company and are to some extent covered by Group contribution
restrictions, which affects the time frame for utilisation to an estimated one to five years.


### Deferred tax

The item deferred taxes in the consolidated balance sheet relates to tax expense on untaxed reserves, as well as
acquired intangible assets, deferred tax on leases and deferred tax attributable to tax losses.

The average weighted number of shares amounted to 37,960,086 (35,828,726) and has been affected by the new
share issue in November 2022 and the redemption of warrants. The total number of ordinary shares increased by
190,590 shares during the year.

Earnings per share are calculated as profit after tax attributable to the parent company's shareholders less
dividends to preference shareholders, divided by the weighted number of outstanding ordinary shares.

Earnings per share after dilution are calculated by adjusting the weighted number of ordinary shares plus the
dilutive effect of dilution. Warrants under incentive programmes are included in the calculation only if the closing
price exceeds the subscription price.

The preference share is excluded from the calculation, as the preference share in its format only entitles the holder
to a dividend of SEK 8 per year: see Note 22 for more information.

Earnings per share after dilution refers to incentive programmes. Please refer to Note 7 for information on the
programme.

## Note 12 Goodwill


### Accounting policies

Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from assets that
are not individually identifiable, and is recognised separately by the Group
on acquisition. Goodwill is calculated as the part of the purchase price that
exceeds the fair value of the percentage of the acquired company's assets
that the Group acquires on the acquisition date. The cash flows from these
individual acquisitions are directly and indirectly influenced by the
coordination that takes place within the segment led by the segment
manager. A subsidiary therefore contributes to the cash flows of other
entities within the segment in accordance with IAS 36:81. Therefore, these
groups of cash-generating entities are aggregated within the segment to
which they belong for the purpose of monitoring goodwill under IAS 36:82.
The two business areas represent the lowest level in Sdiptech at which
goodwill is monitored in the internal governance of the Group. The groups
of cash-generating entities are not larger than the company's operating
segments.

Under IFRS 3, the cost of acquisition is equal to the sum of the
consideration paid, the value of the non-controlling interest in the
acquisition and the fair value of the previously held interest in the acquired
subsidiary. Goodwill arising from the acquisition of foreign entities outside
the Eurozone is treated as an asset of the foreign entity and translated at
the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date.


### Impairment testing of non-financial assets

Under IFRS, goodwill is not amortised but tested annually in accordance
with IAS 36. Sdiptech tests goodwill for impairment at least annually by
calculating the value in use of the cash-generating entities on the basis of
the grouping of the cash-generating entities.

The future cash flows that each group of cash-generating entities is
expected to generate are discounted in order to determine the value in use
of the asset. The companies' strategic plan for the next three years
constitutes the basis for future cash flows; for the period thereafter, growth
is assumed based on a generally assessed sustainable GDP growth of 2
per cent (2). Where the calculation indicates that the value in use is less
than the carrying amount, the impairment test results in an impairment loss.
The impairment assessment also takes into account additional volatility so
as to ensure that no reasonably possible changes in the above-mentioned
inputs are deemed to result in impairment.

The sales forecast is based on assessments of factors such as order
intake, the economy and market conditions. The forecast of operating
expenses is based on assessments of gross margin and the development
of significant cost items for running the companies' operations, such as
premises, current wage agreements and previous annual levels of gross
margin and overheads, adapted to an expectation for the coming year on
the basis of aspects such as those mentioned for the sales forecast.

Anticipated investments in working capital and fixed assets are linked to
historical data to which specific investment needs of a material nature are
added on the basis of the strategic plan. Consideration is also given to
lease assets and liabilities under IFRS 16 that are included in the
impairment assessment. Significant factors expected to affect future
outcomes are taken into account in addition to financial projections.
Forecasts and assessments are made per group of cash flow generating
entities.

Estimated cash flows for cash-generating entities are discounted using a
discount rate of 8.7 (8.5) per cent after tax. The cash-generating entities
operate in several countries. The operational risk in the cash flows is
considered to be similar, which is why the same discount rate (WACC) has
been used. In terms of financial risk, the operations are in related industries
and so the optimal financing structure is deemed to be similar.

The calculation for the year shows that the value in use exceeds the
carrying amount, while a sensitivity assessment shows that the remaining
goodwill value would still be defended if the discount rate were to be
increased by 2 pp. The result of the impairment test for the year is that no
impairment has been recognised during the financial year (0).

The corporate executive believes that no reasonable changes in the
significant assumptions made will cause the estimated aggregate
recoverable amount of the entities above to be less than their aggregate
carrying amount.

Gains and losses on the disposal of a subsidiary include the goodwill
attributable to the entity sold. If the Group's share of the net fair value of the
investment exceeds its cost, after revaluation, the difference is recognised
directly in the income statement.

The Group's goodwill of SEK 4,625.9 (4,299.0) million relates to the core
business.

## Note 13 Other intangible assets


### Accounting policies

Intangible assets include capitalised development costs, IT software,
patents, trademarks, licences and other rights. These are broken down into
acquired intangible assets and intangible assets generated internally


### Development costs

The Group conducts certain development activities in the form of
development and patenting of both products and technologies.
Development expenditure is recognised as development costs in the
income statement as incurred. If the requirements for internally generated
intangible assets under IAS 38 are met, the development that has taken
place is capitalised and included in the Other intangible assets item. The
standard requires development costs to relate to identifiable and unique
assets controlled by the Group. Capitalisation occurs if it is technically
feasible to complete the asset, if the intention is to use or sell the asset, if it
can be demonstrated that future economic benefits are likely, and if the
expenditure can be measured reliably.


### Other intangible assets

Acquired intangible assets must be recognised separately from goodwill if
they meet the definition of an asset, if they are either separable or arise
from contracts or other legal rights and if their fair value can be measured
reliably.

The Group identifies and measures intangible assets in major acquisitions
on the basis of customer-related, brand or technology-based intangible
assets and assesses the useful life of the asset. A simplified approach is
adopted for smaller acquisitions whereby the most significant value is
identified. Trade names, service marks, certification marks, customer
records, order or production backlogs, long-term contracts with customers
and related customer relationships are typical customer-related and brand
assets. Technology-based intangible assets normally consist of patented
technology and software. The valuation of contracts with customers and
related customer relationships at fair value is based on the proportion of
these which is expected to be retained and the expected remaining cash
flow from the customer.

### Note 13, cont.

Trademarks are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis according to
the relief from royalty method.

Other intangible assets are recognised if it is probable that the future
economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and that
the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.

Intangible assets normally have a limited useful life. These assets are
recognised at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated
impairment losses.

Amortisation of intangible assets

Amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful life of the intangible assets at cost less accumulated
amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not
amortised.

The following depreciation periods are applied:
IPR, patents and licences: 5-15 years Trademarks: 5-25 years
Customer relations: 3-15 years
R&D: 5-20 years
Software: 5-10 years


### Impairment testing of intangible assets

Assets that are depreciated or impaired are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. The impairment made corresponds to the
amount by which the book value of the asset exceeds its recovery value.
The recovery value is the highest of asset's fair value minus sales costs and
value in use. For intangible assets, the testing period was the remaining
expected economic life of the asset.

For intangible assets, an assessment is made at each balance sheet date as
to whether a reversal should take place. Impairment loss is only reversed to
the extent that the asset's carrying amount after reversal does not exceed
the carrying amount that the asset would have had if impairment had not
been recognised-accounting for depreciation or amortisation that would
have occurred.

The year's increase in intangible assets relates mainly to acquired intangible
assets: see Note 3 Business combinations. Moreover, intangible assets
have increased due to the capitalisation of research and development for
proprietary products and services. Other intangible assets include
software.

## Note 14 Fixed assets


### Accounting policies

Tangible assets acquired by Group companies are recognised at cost.
Assets coming into the Group in connection with the acquisition of new
subsidiaries are recognised at fair value at the date of acquisition. They are
amortised on a pro rata basis over their estimated useful life, adjusted for
any impairment and disposal costs.

The value in the consolidated statement of financial position represents
expenses less grants and subsidies received, and less accumulated
depreciation and any impairment losses. Interest costs on loans for funding
the construction of such assets are capitalised as part of the acquisition
cost when the facility is completed.

Land is considered to have an indefinite useful life and is not amortised, but
is tested at least annually for impairment. Amortisation for other assets is
based on the following expected useful lives:

The cost of tangible assets is depreciated over their estimated useful life,
which results in the following average depreciation periods for the Group:
Equipment, tools, fixtures and fittings: 3-15 years
Office and industrial buildings: 25-50 years


#### Impairment and reversal of impairment of tangible assets

Assets that are depreciated or impaired are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable.


## Note 15 Leases


### Accounting policies

When a contract is signed, the Group must assess whether the contract is,
or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract
conveys the right to control the use of a specific asset for a specified period
of time in exchange for payment (see Note 23 in respect of lease liabilities)
and there is no substantive right of exchange.

At the start of the lease or on reassessment of a lease containing multiple
components, lease and non-lease components, the Group allocates the
consideration under the lease to each component based on the stand-
alone price. Expenditure related to non-lease components is expensed.
Components that cannot be separated are recognised as a single lease
component. Lease terms are negotiated on the basis of individual
assessments and include a variety of conditions.

Sdiptech has chosen to apply two relief rules in connection with lease
accounting; no right-of-use asset and lease liability are recognised for
leases with a term of less than 12 months, or if the agreement relates to an
underlying asset of low value. Lease payments for these leases are
recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
For impairment testing, see the section entitled Impairment and reversal of
impairment in Note 14.


### Leases where the Group is the lessee

The Group has many small and medium-sized subsidiaries in various
countries and locations. As a result, there are a large number of contracts
and many different terms and conditions. There are no individually
significant leases for the Group.

### Note 15, cont.


#### Premises

Sdiptech has about 70 rental agreements related to premises for
warehouses and offices. Lease agreements normally have a duration of
between 3 and 20 years, the duration varying between types of premises,
but also to a large extent between different geographical regions.
Extension options exist to varying degrees as part of statutory security of
tenure in some markets. The assessment of whether the extension option
will be exercised is assessed on the balance sheet date on the basis of
whether it can be assessed with reasonable certainty that the contract will
be extended, given a number of parameters linked to the individual
company's development and growth, such as investments made in the
premises.

The Group has variable lease payments in its lease agreements, such as
property tax, VAT and other variable property costs such as maintenance
costs, electricity, heating and water, etc. These are excluded from the lease
liability calculation insofar as the costs can be easily separated from the
rental cost. None of the leases include significant variable lease payments.


#### Vehicles

The Group leases vehicles with lease periods that normally run for 3-5
years. Most of the leases run until the end date of the underlying lease
agreement. Extension options exist only to an insignificant extent. There
are also residual value guarantees in some instances. These are treated as
part of the asset and liability if it is deemed likely that they will be utilised.


#### Other contracts

There are also other leases such as machinery and IT equipment, with
lease periods of between two and ten years.


#### Leases where the Group is the lessor

There are a few entities in the Group that offer rental of products, in addition
to sales. Revenue from the rental of goods is recognised on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. There is also one company that has an
agreement regarding the rental of part of the office premises on the
balance sheet date, which is not considered to be the companies' operating
activities; revenue for remuneration is recognised under other income. The
contracts are deemed immaterial for the Group.

## Note 17 Financial risks and risk management


### Financial instruments

Financial instruments recognised on the asset side in the consolidated
balance sheet include trade receivables, short-term investments and cash
and cash equivalents. Liabilities include loans, contingent considerations,
other current liabilities and trade payables.

Transaction costs related to financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair
value in the income statement are expensed directly in the income
statement. Trade receivables without a significant financing component are
valued at the transaction price.


### Classification and valuation

Financial instruments are classified in different categories. Financial assets
are classified on the basis of the company's business model for managing
the financial assets and the characteristics of the contractual cash flows
from the financial asset.

The Group's categorisation of financial instruments is as follows:

They are financial assets if the maturity or expected holding period is
longer than one year.

Financial assets valued at accrued acquisition cost
This category mainly comprises trade receivables, other current
receivables and cash and cash equivalents. Assets are recognised at
amortised cost less any provision for impairment. Amounts are not
discounted when the effect is not material.

This category also includes financial investments and non-current
receivables that are managed within a business model that can be
described as "held to maturity", which means collecting the contractual
cash flows from the financial assets. The contractual cash flows from all
receivables within the category of financial assets measured at amortised
cost are considered solely to be payments of principal and interest on the
outstanding principal amount.

A loss allowance is assessed for financial assets measured at amortised
cost. For all these financial assets, with the exception of trade receivables,
an assessment of the loss allowance is made on the basis of 12 months of
expected credit losses, or on the expected credit losses for the remaining
term if the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition.
The assessment is made at the balance sheet date.

For trade receivables, a simplified method is applied whereby a loss
allowance is recognised corresponding to the expected credit losses for
the remaining term of the contract.

Companies estimate and evaluate credit risk using available information on
historical credit events, current circumstances and forecasts of future
developments. Impairment losses are recognised on a separate line in the
income statement.

Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive
income

Sdiptech currently has no financial assets related to a business model in
this category.

Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss
Liabilities for contingent additional purchase prices arising in business
combinations are measured at fair value through profit or loss, including put
options whereby Group companies are obliged to purchase their own
equity instruments and then pay proceeds corresponding to the fair value
of the equity instrument. The valuation of these belongs to valuation level 3,
where the valuation is based on the expected future financial performance
of the acquired business as assessed by the corporate executive.

Sdiptech has agreements on currency futures in GBP and EUR, currency
interest rate futures in GBP, EUR and NOK and interest rate futures in SEK
and EUR in order to balance the currency and interest rate exposure. The
fair value of forward contracts is determined on the basis of the forward
exchange rate on the balance sheet date. The derivatives mature within 12
months and are recognised at fair value through the income statement
under financial income and expenses.

Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost

This category includes all financial liabilities other than those measured at
fair value through profit or loss. Loans to credit institutions as well as bonds,
trade payables and certain other operating liabilities are included in this
category. These are recognised at amortised cost, and any difference
between the borrowing amount (net of transaction costs) and the
repayment amount is recognised in profit or loss over the period of the loan
using the effective interest method. Trade payables have short maturities
and are measured at nominal value without discounting.


### Risks and uncertainty factors


#### Financial risks

Sdiptech is exposed to financial risks of various kinds through its activities:

. Liquidity risk and financing risk

. Interest rate risk

. Currency risk

. Customer and counterparty risk


#### Financial policy

Sdiptech's Board of Directors has adopted the company's financial policy.
This policy sets out the company's financial strategy and internal
responsibilities. The policy also regulates factors such as how funding,
liquidity management and currency risk are managed within the Group, as
well as the limitations to be considered regarding counterparties.

Overview of the Group's financial assets and liabilities
Sdiptech has used generally accepted methods to calculate the fair value
of the Group's financial instruments as at 31 December 2023 and 2022.
Promissory notes and contingent considerations refer to different types of
obligations to the selling party and are linked to conditions based on the
performance of the acquired companies over a certain period following the
acquisition. The liabilities are recognised at the present value of the
expected outflows, and revaluations are recognised in profit or loss. For
more information, please see Note 3.

The book value has been assumed to be a good approximation of the
amortised cost or all other financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and
cash equivalents, trade receivables and trade payables.

Contingent considerations refer to different types of obligations to the
selling party that are linked to conditions based on the performance of the
acquired companies over a certain period following the acquisition. These
liabilities are recognised at the present value of the expected outflows. See
Note 3 for valuation techniques for contingent considerations.

The valuation of the financial year noted increases in the expected
outcome from a number of entities, which resulted in an adjustment of the
increased liability. This has been recognised in the income statement
under Other external costs. All obligations at the balance sheet date fall
due within 1-8 years.


### Credit risk in respect of receivables Credit risks in trade receivables.

Credit risk exposure to customers is continuously assessed within the
Group; the credit risk is varied, as the customer base within the Group
ranges from private to government operations. The Group's exposure to
individual customers is small, and risk diversification is deemed to be good.
Total trade receivables on the balance sheet date amounted to SEK 827.3
(687.0) million, corresponding to an increase of 20 per cent, which largely
comes from comparable entities. Provisions for future credit losses

amount to SEK 10.4 (6.3) million. Receivables older than 60 days past due
amount to SEK 54.6 (50.8) million. Provision and utilisation of the provision
for doubtful trade receivables have been recognised in the income
statement. Age analysis of trade receivables and provisions for expected
credit losses are presented in Note 19.

Trade receivables and other receivables are assessed at each balance
sheet date according to estimated credit risk and, if necessary, provisions
are made according to assessed credit risk in accordance with IFRS 9. In
addition to age analysis, the basis for assessment is made up of credit
information, the customer's established payment patterns and other
available information affecting credit, such as lost contracts, changes in
management functions and other company-specific information. A
macroeconomic assessment is also made of the future industry and
country-specific outlook for the Group's customers. No loss allowance has
been recognised for other receivables as the assessment corresponding
to 12 months of expected credit losses is deemed to be immaterial.

Credit risk in treasury management mainly arises from the investment of
cash and cash equivalents; no surplus liquidity was available for investment
during the financial year, and no credit risk is deemed to exist.


### Liquidity risk and financing risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may encounter difficulties in meeting
its obligations associated with financial liabilities, while financing risk is the
risk that the financing of the Group's capital requirements is made more
difficult or more expensive. Bank financing on the balance sheet date
consists of what is known as a revolving credit facility (RCF) of SEK 800
million with Nordea and an agreement on a cash pool for efficient cash
management within the Group and its companies. The Group renewed its
credit agreements in 2022. These agreements, with two different financial
institutions, run for three years with an option to extend. During the period,
the Group increased its agreed long-term credit line by SEK 500 million to a
total of SEK 2,600 million and GBP 36 million, corresponding to about SEK
460 million. The total utilised credit volume as at 31 December 2023, within
this credit line, totalled SEK 1,823.4 million. The Group's interest-bearing
liabilities and maturities are shown in Note 23.

In August, Sdiptech issued senior secured sustainability-linked bonds of
SEK 600 million under a framework of SEK 1,000 million. These bonds
carry a variable interest rate of 3m Stibor +4.90 per cent and mature in
August 2027. The link to the Group's sustainability goals affects the final
redemption amount at maturity, depending on the outcome.

The Group seeks to achieve a reasonable balance between equity, debt
financing and liquidity so that the Group secures financing at a reasonable
cost of capital. At year-end, interest-bearing liabilities amounted to 44.7
(44.3) per cent of the balance sheet total. Interest-bearing liabilities also
include contingent considerations where the underlying liabilities do not
bear interest, but are discounted in the Group and are viewed as a financial
liability.


### Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that unfavourable changes in interest rates will
have an excessive impact on the Group's net financial position and results.

The company may have invested in interest-bearing assets whose value
changes when interest rates change.

The cost of the company's borrowing changes when interest rates change.
Options to fix the interest rate for all or part of a loan are evaluated at regular
intervals. However, all of the Group's bank loans carried variable interest
rates at 3 to 6-month intervals at year-end, as in the previous year. The
Group also has agreements on interest rate swaps, corresponding to
around 25 per cent of the agreed credit volume, with a 2 to 3-year maturity.
Part of the contracted credit volume is linked to the Group's sustainability
goals, which may increase or decrease the contracted interest margin
depending on the outcome.

#### Note 17, cont.

Sdiptech has no long-term surplus liquidity and does not normally invest
funds in anything other than short-term bank deposits. There is therefore
no significant interest rate risk in the Group's short-term investments.
Hence changes in interest rates mainly affect the company's borrowing
costs.

The Group measures interest rate risk as the change, based on liabilities to
credit institutions at year-end, given a 1 per cent increase in interest rates
on a full-year basis. According to this calculation, the interest rate risk on
the balance sheet date is expected to result in around SEK 12.8 (15.4)
million in higher interest expenses, including the effect of interest rate
futures.


### Currency risk

Currency risk is the risk that unfavourable changes in exchange rates will
affect the Group's earnings and equity measured in SEK. The Group's
currency risks are mainly linked to the foreign subsidiaries, which have
income and expenses in currencies other than the individual company's
functional currency (what is known as transaction exposure), and through
the translation exposure that arises when foreign subsidiaries' assets and
liabilities are translated into the parent company's functional currency.

The Group's earnings are most sensitive to changes in the GBP/SEK
exchange rate. A 10 per cent change in the average exchange rate of all
currencies against the Swedish krona would have an impact of SEK 75.3
(58.2) million on the Group's operating profit and SEK 45.6 (44.8) million on
the Group's profit before tax, excluding unrealised currency effects of
internal and external loans and currency futures.

Sdiptech has entered into agreements on currency futures in GBP and
EUR in order to balance the currency exposure. These volumes totalled the
equivalent of around SEK 402 million and SEK 355 million respectively at
the end of the period. Derivatives are recognised at fair value under
financial income and expenses in the income statement.

In an international Group like Sdiptech, it is important to offer customers
and suppliers payment options in their own currency. This means that the
Group is constantly takes foreign exchange risk with both trade receivables
and trade payables in foreign currencies. However, the risk exposure is

limited as most of the sales of products and services related to
infrastructure take place locally in each country in which Sdiptech's
operations are located and operate.

The total currency exposure of the Group is shown in the following table of
the Group's gross exposure. The Group's assets and liabilities are shown
for each underlying accounting currency, of which the Group's central debt
is included in the SEK item below. A 10 per cent strengthening of SEK
against EUR would affect equity by around SEK -13.2 (-26.8) million. A 10
per cent strengthening of SEK against GBP would affect equity by SEK
-101.7 (-55.6) million when translating the currency exposure of net
investments in foreign subsidiaries.

##### Translation exposure in the statement of financial position

A single subsidiary should not normally have any translation risk in its own
balance sheet. This means that a subsidiary's foreign currency assets and
liabilities shall be balanced. Moreover, subsidiaries usually borrow in their
own currency. In practice, this is only relevant when loans are raised in
connection with the acquisition, and in the case of loans between
subsidiaries and the parent company. Since a large part of the Group's
assets in the form of equity are in foreign Group companies, a form of
currency hedging is carried out by allocating the Group's loans partly to
foreign currency, which in turn corresponds to a certain part of the loans
raised when acquiring foreign Group companies. The translation exposure

in the Group's equity may be significant for certain periods with strong
exchange rate fluctuations. The largest exposures are in GBP and EUR.

The table below shows the breakdown of currency exposure in equity for
the most significant currencies. The exposures are in GBP and EUR. The
table below shows, in local currency, the breakdown of currency exposure
in equity for the most significant currencies.

## Note 18 Inventories


### Accounting policies

Inventories are recognised at the lower of cost and net realisable value
where cost is determined by the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle, or by a
weighted average value if it can be assumed to be close to the FIFO value.
The cost of finished goods and work in progress consists of commodities,
direct labour costs, depreciation, other direct costs and overheads related
to the goods, but not interest costs. Net realisable value is the estimated
selling price in the ordinary course of business less costs of completion
and sale.

Depreciation deductions are also made for finished goods and spare parts
that are old, obsolete or have a low turnover rate. Such impairment loss is
deducted from the book value of the inventory in the consolidated
statement of financial position.

## Note 19 Trade receivables


### Accounting policies

Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and then adjusted to the value expected to be received after
an assessment of the provision for expected credit losses based on a forward-looking and objective review of all
outstanding amounts at the end of the period. A simplified procedure has been introduced for trade receivables in
accordance with IFRS 9, whereby the provisions recognised under other external costs in the consolidated income
statement are based on expected credit losses over the remaining life of the receivables. Recovery of amounts
previously written off is credited to other external charges in the income statement.

The trade receivables item consists of many smaller amounts as the Group consists of more than 60 operating
companies. The Group's trade receivables are classified as current assets as they normally have a remaining
service life of less than 6 months.

The cost of customer losses and doubtful debts recognised in the income statement amounts to SEK 5.8 (9.0)
million net.

Collateral is not normally held for trade receivables. The Group's customers consist of a good spread from private
players to large companies, municipalities and public authorities, with low credit risk for the Group, which is
reflected in the history, and the credit quality of outstanding trade receivables is deemed to be very good. There are
no significant credit concentrations. Provisions for doubtful trade receivables are made individually in accordance
with internal regulations and normally when receivables are more than 60 days past due. The provision for doubtful
debts and doubtful debt losses is included in Other external costs.

## Note 22 Share capital and other contributed capital


### Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Transaction costs directly
attributable to the issue of new shares are recognised in equity as a
deduction from the issue proceeds.

Preference shares are classified as equity. Sdiptech has the option of
deciding on the redemption of preference shares. Dividends on preference
shares require a resolution of the general meeting. Holders of preference
shares have no right to call for redemption or claim dividends.


### Earnings per share

The calculation of earnings per share is based on the consolidated profit
for the year attributable to the parent company's shareholders, and on the
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. When
calculating diluted earnings per share, the average number of shares is
adjusted to take into account the effects of dilutive potential ordinary
shares, which relate to share-based payment programmes issued to
employees during the reported periods. Dilution occurs only when the
exercise price is lower than the market price and increases as the
difference increases.


### Group

The shares have a quota value of SEK 0.025 per share. Each class B
ordinary share carries one vote, while each class A ordinary share carries
10 votes.


### Shares

Sdiptech's shares have been issued in accordance with Swedish law and
are registered with Euroclear Sweden AB, "Euroclear", in electronic form.
Euroclear also maintains the company's share register. The company's
shares are denominated in SEK and are fully paid up.

According to the Articles of Association, the company's share capital must
amount to a minimum of SEK 500,000 and a maximum of SEK 2,000,000,
divided into a minimum of 20,000,000 and a maximum of 80,000,000
shares. According to the Articles of Association, the company can issue
three classes of shares: ordinary shares, class B ordinary shares and
preference shares. Of these, there are a total of 1,424,000 class A ordinary
shares (ISIN: SE0003756741), 36,567,938 class B ordinary shares (ISIN:
SE0003756758) and 1,750,000 preference shares as at 31 December
2023. As of 31 December 2023, the share capital in Sdiptech amounted to
SEK 993,548 divided into 39,741,938 shares, each with a quota value of
SEK 0.025.

#### Note 22, cont.

In order to strengthen the company's financial preparedness to conduct
acquisitions of the nature described above, the company's Board of
Directors made a decision on 11 February 2015 to offer institutional
investors and the general public in Sweden the opportunity to subscribe for
preference shares corresponding to SEK 100 million, with deviation from
shareholders' preferential rights. This offer was extended on 19 February
2015 to include 1,750,000 preference shares corresponding to SEK 175
million. The offer was directed to the general public and institutional
investors and expired on 20 February 2015. Around 1,800 private
individuals and institutional investors were allocated preference shares in
Sdiptech within the framework of the offer. Sdiptech received SEK 175
million in total before issue costs.

In February 2016, additional raising of capital was carried out in the form of
a directed share issue to key personnel at Sdiptech and shareholders in the
related company Serendipity Ixora AB. A total of 1,076,924 class B ordinary
shares were issued at a price of SEK 65 per share, whereby the company
received SEK 70,000,060 and the share capital increased by SEK
26,923.1.

Sdiptech's class B ordinary share was listed on First North Premier on 12
May 2017, and at the same time a new share issue of SEK 500 million
(before costs) was carried out in order to finance future acquisitions.

On 9 June 2020, a directed cash issue of 3,364,182 class B shares took
place at a subscription price of SEK 105.00 per share. The Directed New
Share Issue provided the company with proceeds of around SEK 353
million before deduction of issue costs.

On 3 March 2021, 222,100 class B shares were subscribed for through a
new issue attributable to the exercise of warrants in the first of the three
series introduced as a long-term incentive programme for Sdiptech
managers and senior executives, and adopted in accordance with the
extraordinary general meeting on 5 March 2018 (see also Note 6). This
issue provided the company with SEK 13.3 million in equity.

On 9 March 2021, a directed cash issue of 1,500,000 class B shares took
place at a subscription price of SEK 315 per share. The Directed New Share
Issue provided the company with proceeds of around SEK 473 million
before deduction of issue costs.

On 8 March 2022, 216,100 class B shares were subscribed for through a
new issue attributable to the exercise of warrants in the second of the three
series introduced as a long-term incentive programme for managers and
senior executives in Sdiptech and adopted in accordance with the
extraordinary general meeting on 5 March 2018 (see further Note 6). This
issue provided the company with SEK 14.5 million in equity.

On 5 July 2022, a share issue in kind of 21,321 class B shares took place.
This issue took place as part of the purchase price for the acquisition of
Resource Data Management Ltd (see Note 3). The value of the shares was
calculated at GBP 500,000, which at the time of acquisition corresponded
to SEK 6,170,510.61 or SEK 289.41 per share. Payment has been made
through the contribution of shares in RDM at an equivalent value.

On 16 November 2022, a directed cash issue of 2,200,000 class B shares
took place at a subscription price of SEK 230 per share. The directed share
issue took place with deviation from the existing owners' preferential rights
following a decision made by the Board of Directors based on the
authorisation from the Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2022. The
Directed New Share Issue provides the company with proceeds of around
SEK 506 million before deduction of issue costs.

On 3 March 2023, 190,590 class B shares were subscribed for through a
new issue attributable to the exercise of warrants in the third of the three
series introduced as a long-term incentive programme for managers and
senior executives in Sdiptech and adopted in accordance with the
extraordinary general meeting on 5 March 2018 (see also Note 7). This
issue provided the company with SEK 14.4 million in equity.


### Terms of preference share

In March 2015, 1,750,000 preference shares were issued at an issue price
of SEK 100 per share. Dividends amount to SEK 8 per year, divided into
quarterly payments. The redemption price is SEK 120 for 0-24 months
after issue, SEK 110 for months 25-48, and SEK 105 thereafter. Dividends
on preference shares require a resolution of the general meeting. Holders
of preference shares have no right to call for redemption or claim dividends.


### Dividends

After the balance sheet date, the Board of Directors has submitted the
following proposal for the appropriation of profits.

The Annual General Meeting has at its disposal (SEK):


<table>
<tr>
<td>Share premium reserve</td>
<td>2,094,236,582</td>

<tr>
<td>Retained earnings</td>
<td>218,694,471</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Net profit for the year</td>
<td>5,741,011</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Total</td>
<td>2,318,672,064</td>
</tr>
</table>

*Group liabilities to credit institutions consist of several contracts with different maturities. An
average interest rate on debt to credit institutions is estimated to be 3.1 per cent.


### Loan agreements

During the period, the Group increased its agreed long-term credit line by
SEK 500 million to a total of SEK 2,600 million. The total utilised credit volume
as at 31 December 2023, within this credit line, totalled SEK 1,800 million.
These contracts carry variable interest rates at 3-6 month intervals. However,
the Group has agreements on what are known as
interest rate swaps, corresponding to about 25 per cent of the utilised credit
line, with a 2-3 year term and maturing in 2024-2026, with a view to reducing
interest rate exposure.

The interest rate for the facilities under the loan agreement is variable and
based on IBOR (the IBOR applied is dependent on the currency in which
lending takes place under the agreement), plus a variable margin based on
the Group's net debt to EBITDA ratio. However, the IBOR can be at least O, i.e.
negative interest rates cannot be passed on.

The loan agreement contains conditions that require certain financial ratios
(covenants) to be met. Part of the contracted credit volume is linked to the
Group's sustainability goals, which may increase or decrease the contracted
interest margin depending on the outcome. The loan facilities may be
cancelled for repayment if the conditions are not met.

The variable interest margin on the loan agreement amounts to 2.2-7.5 per
cent, of which the average interest rate for the financial year amounts to 4.9
(3.1) per cent. The loan is recognised under Long-term loans to credit
institutions and Current liabilities to credit institutions. It also includes loans to
credit institutions raised by the Group's subsidiaries outside the central credit
facility. These loans amounted to SEK 63.8 (58.5) million as of 31 December
2023.

In August, Sdiptech issued senior secured sustainability-linked bonds of SEK
600 million under a framework of SEK 1,000 million. These bonds carry a
variable interest rate of 3m Stibor +4.90 per cent and mature in August 2027.
The link to the Group's sustainability goals affects the final redemption
amount at maturity, depending on the outcome.

The amounts recognised, by currency, for the Group's borrowings are as
