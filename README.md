# CEO statement

We are very proud about Sobi's performance in the first quarter; growth was a strong 20 per cent at CER and the adjusted EBITA margin was 37 per cent. This positive momentum makes us confident on delivering quarter on quarter growth in the second quarter, also supported by higher level of field activity during February and March and strong positive feedback in recent market research.

In the first quarter, our strategic portfolio, which includes our medicines Aspaveli/Empaveli, Doptelet excluding China, Gamifant, Vonjo and Zynlonta and royalty from Altuviiio and Beyfortus, was the driving force behind our top-line growth. Our strategic portfolio grew 177 per cent at CER and accounted for 35 (15) per cent of revenue in the first quarter, underpinning our strategy to further transform our company with innovative and differentiated medicines. Our commitment to addressing rare diseases, our expansion into global markets, and effective execution of our strategy collectively contributed to this success.

Our increasing international presence is building on our commitment to enhance access to our medicines as a key sustainability priority and is vital to fully develop the potential of our medicines for patients and maximise the life cycle of our portfolio.

Haematology revenue increased by 46 per cent at CER in the quarter, driven by the addition of Vonjo, continued strong growth of Doptelet and supported by sales of Elocta® and Alprolix®. Efanesoctocog alfa has the potential to become a new standard of care for people living with haemophilia A and we have a comprehensive program in place to generate more clinical data while awaiting regulatory decisions in Europe.

Vonjo has considerable potential to help patients worldwide with the blood cancer myelofibrosis. As highlighted in the fourth quarter 2023, an insufficient amount of new patient starts in 2023 was expected to negatively impact sales in the first quarter 2024. This effect was amplified by year-end changes in insurance coverage of patients with a muted start in January, however, our newly focused commercial and medical teams have created a consistent increase in sales during the quarter. Our March sales were 29 per cent higher than average sales in January and February.

Immunology revenue declined by 11 per cent at CER in the first quarter, reflecting a significant drop in Synagis sales. This was mostly an effect of competition from Beyfortus, but also of the peak of the RSV-season being reached already in December. The reduction in Synagis sales negatively impacted the gross margin. The royalty revenue that we earned from Sanofi's sales of Beyfortus only partially compensated for the lost Synagis sales in the first quarter. We expect a positive outlook for the RSV franchise when the Beyfortus and Synagis dynamic settles.

Gamifant sales doubled in the quarter and contributed significantly, thanks to our successful medical education approach, which has increased knowledge about Gamifant among treating clinicians. Kineret® also contributed strong growth in all regions.

We are gratified that the US FDA has granted a fast track designation for SEL-212 confirming our belief in the potential medical benefit of this investigational product.

In the first quarter, we closed manufacturing and received our last revenue for ReFacto. A big thanks to our technical operations team for the completion of these activities.

All in all, we are very pleased with the strong performance in this first quarter of the year and look forward to capitalising on this current momentum.

Solna, Sweden, 25 April 2024
Guido Oelkers, President & CEO


# Financial performance

## Total revenue

Total revenue for January to March ('the first quarter' or 'the quarter') was SEK 6,256 M (5,239) and increased by 19 per cent compared with the same period a year ago and by 20 per cent at CER. The increase was driven by strong performance in launch medicines with Vonjo, Doptelet, Gamifant and Aspaveli/Empaveli as main contributors together with royalty earned on Sanofi's sales of Altuviiio and Beyfortus. Performance was further supported by growth for Elocta, Alprolix and Kineret. The quarter was also impacted by a significant reduction in sales for Synagis.

Doptelet sales were SEK 756 M (475) in the quarter and increased by 59 per cent, 59 per cent at CER. The strong sales growth was driven by increased uptake in the US, ongoing launches in the regions Europe and International as well as increased market share in launched countries.

Zynlonta sales were SEK 13 M (3) in the quarter.

Vonjo sales were SEK 320 M (—) in the quarter, with a continued launch progress. Quarter-over-quarter sales were flat at CER impacted by the insufficient amount of new patient starts in 2023 and year end changes in insurance coverage; however, they were balanced by positive sales momentum in the later part of the quarter.

Contract manufacturing of ReFacto AF/Xyntha for Pfizer was permanently closed during the quarter. Sales in the quarter amounted to SEK 375 M (189). There will be no more manufacturing sales in coming quarters.

## Haematology

Doptelet: Positive results from phase 3 paediatric study
In March, Sobi announced positive results from its phase 3 study of Doptelet for treatment of children and adolescents with ITP, AVA-PED-301. The study enrolled 75 subjects between 1 and 17 years old and met its primary endpoint of durable treatment response in 28 per cent of patients in the treatment arm, compared to 0 per cent for placebo. The secondary endpoint for platelet count was met in 82 per cent of Doptelet subjects, compared to 0 per cent in placebo. Full results will be presented at an upcoming medical conference. Sobi plans to submit the US and EU application for a paediatric indication in the second half of this year.

Pegcetacoplan received positive CHMP opinion for 1L PNH
On January 25th Pegcetacoplan received positive CHMP opinion for first line (1L) treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) who have haemolytic anaemia.

## Immunology

Kineret was approved in China for Still's disease
On March 15, the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) approved Kineret for the treatment of Still's disease in China. Still's is the largest of the three conditions that Sobi had applied for. In 2023, Sobi received approval for Kineret in the smaller indications familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS).

SEL-212 received FDA fast track designation
In March, Sobi received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) fast track designation for SEL-212 in chronic refractory gout (CRG). SEL-212 is a novel once-monthly investigational combination medicine in development that is intended to reduce serum urate (SU) levels in people with CRG. Fast track designation is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of medicines to treat serious conditions that may fill an unmet medical need.

# Other information

## Significant events

### During the quarter

#### Joint venture for rare disease business in South Korea
Sobi and Handok established a joint venture, SOBI-HANDOK CO., LTD, for the rare disease business in South Korea. The joint venture is expected to enhance the Sobi and Handok collaboration. Strengthening their position in the rare disease business, Sobi and Handok aim to develop, commercialise and distribute Sobi's innovative medicines in South Korea. Sobi owns 51 percent and Handok owns 49 per cent of the shares in the joint venture.

#### Pegcetacoplan CAD program terminated
In January, Sobi and the collaboration partner Apellis jointly decided to stop the CASCADE phase 3 study (EudraCT Number 2021-003160-27 / NCT05096403) evaluating the efficacy and safety of pegcetacoplan in patients with Cold Agglutinin Disease (CAD). This was due to a realignment of Sobi's and Apellis' development activities as there is a decreased medical need in CAD and therefore a limited number of patients eligible for the study. There were no safety concerns and efficacy was not evaluated due to the blind design of the study.

#### Annette Clancy assumed the role of Chair of the Board
On January 5, 2024, Board member Annette Clancy assumed the role of Chair of the Board with immediate effect. She has been a board member of Sobi since 2014 and has extensive experience from executive positions and board positions in the pharmaceutical industry. Bo Jesper Hansen resigned at his own request and with immediate effect due to health reasons.

## Sustainability
Sobi's sustainability efforts support the overall mission of working together to find and make available medicines that transform the lives of people with rare and debilitating diseases and are based on two priorities:

- Maintain commitment to patients
- Always act responsibly

During the quarter, Sobi reached further milestones in the strive to expand access to medicine. Positive results from the phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Doptelet (avatrombopag) for the treatment of children and adolescents with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) were announced. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales published guidance recommending the use of Zynlonta (loncastuximab tesirine) for treating relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL) after 2 or more systemic treatments.

Sobi presented new data and shared knowledge in the Annual Congress of European Association for Haemophilia and Allied Disorders (EAHAD) in Frankfurt, Germany, as part of its ongoing commitment to expanding knowledge and elevating standards of care within haemophilia. In Vienna, Sobi organised the third Complement 3 Assembly (C3A), a combined onsite and virtual event focusing on paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH). About 100 healthcare professionals as well as global PNH experts from four continents participated in the event.

World Rare Disease Day was commemorated around the Sobi world through information campaigns in media as well as external and internal learning and awareness building events highlighting the global rare disease community and work of patient organisations and other stakeholders.

The Sobi framework for Employee Resource Groups, employee-led groups connected to the topics of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) became available for all Sobi employees globally.


Sobi's Engagement survey continued to show a positive trend in 2024, improving from 73 to 75 points, which is one point over benchmark. Participation rate was 87 per cent, versus a benchmark of 75 per cent.

# Note 3 | Fair value of financial instruments

The following table shows financial instruments measured at fair value, based on their classification in the fair value hierarchy. Sobi's financial instruments at fair value at the end of the quarter consisted of equity instruments, derivatives held for trading, endowment policies and contingent value rights (CVRs).

Due to the merger of Selecta Biosciences with Cartesian Therapeutics Sobi received transferable CVRs which entitles Sobi to recieve future royalty and milestone payments related to SEL-212 and all other legacy Selecta assets.

Equity instruments are categorised within level 1 and consisted of the Group's holding of quoted shares in Cartesian Therapeutics, Inc. Fair value measurement is based on quoted prices in active markets. Derivatives held for trading are categorised within level 2 and consisted of currency derivatives forward contracts. Fair value measurement is based on published forward prices. Endowment policies and CVRs are categorised within level 3. Endowment policies are reported gross with the corresponding liability, which is reported as other liabilities. Fair value measurement for the CVRs are based on a discounted cash flow analysis (DCF) which uses a number of estimates regarding amount and timing of future cash flows. The key assumptions in cash flows are probability of success for regulatory approval of SEL-212 in the US and estimated sales. During the quarter a dividend of SEK 38 M linked to the CVRs have been recognised within net financial items. No transfers have been made between the levels during the period.

Liabilities linked to contingent considerations attributable to intangible assets acquired were SEK 4,748 M (5,022 on 31 December 2023). These are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Fair value for these liabilities was SEK 4,313 M (4,609 on 31 December 2023 ). All other financial instruments on the balance sheet had reported values that are in all material aspects equivalent to fair value on 31 March 2024.

The purchase price allocation (PPA) is preliminary as the deferred tax asset on acquired net operating losses (NOLs) are being investigated. Goodwill amounts to SEK 3,126 M and is determined as follows:

1. The fair value attributable to intangible assets was SEK 17,479 M and represents the intellectual property rights of Vonjo. The fair value was determined using a DCF which uses a number of estimates regarding amount and timing of future cash flows. The key assumptions in cash flows are probability of technical success (PTS) of the PACIFICA trial, peak year sales and competitive pressure in myelofibrosis.

2. The fair value of the inventory was estimated at SEK 772 M, an uplift of SEK 765 M on the carrying value prior to the acquisition. Costs associated with procurement of APIs, production, labelling and packaging has been expensed by CTI until the FDA approval of Vonjo. Therefore, part of the revaluation to fair value of work in progress and finished goods represents the standard cost value. The fair value was calculated as the estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell the inventory and associated margins on these activities. The release of the fair value on the inventory, excluding the standard cost value, is recognised as an IAC.

3. Other assets includes deferred tax of SEK 1,418 M (previously estimated to SEK 1,574 M), mainly consisting of NOLs. The change in the quarter mainly relates to changes in NOLs, which are preliminary. Deferred tax liabilities are primarily attributable to the Vonjo intangible asset.

4. Other liabilities and provisions includes contingent considerations and a term loan to DRI Healthcare Trust (DRI). Contingent considerations are linked to milestone payments for Vonjo of up to USD 108 M. These have been recognised to fair value according to Sobis principles for contingent considerations as described in the Annual and sustainability report for 2023, Note 2 and 4. The term loan was recognised at fair value and repaid by Sobi directly after closing of the acquisition.

5. In 2021 CTI and DRI entered into a royalty financing agreement through which CTI received USD 65 M in initial upfront payment and milestone payment. DRI is entitled under the agreement to receive tiered royalty based on annual net sales of up to USD 400 M of Vonjo in the US. CTI recorded the agreement as royalty financing obligation on the balance sheet. The fair value of the obligation has been considered in the value of the intangible asset Vonjo as the agreement does not contain subjective acceleration clauses or provisions that would require repayment of funding. Sobi expense royalty as cost of goods sold in the same period as the corresponding sales occurs.


# Alternative performance measures – financial measures not defined according to IFRS

Sobi uses certain financial measures, Alternative performance measures (APM) in this report that are not defined according to IFRS. Sobi considers these measures to provide valuable supplementary information for stakeholders and company management, as they enable an assessment and benchmarking of the company's reporting. Since not all companies calculate financial measures in the same way, these are not always comparable to measures used by other companies. The alternative performance measures should not, therefore, be regarded as substitutes for measures defined according to IFRS. See below metrics not defined according to IFRS and definitions used, referred to and presented in this report. Numbers are presented in SEK M unless otherwise stated.

## Change at CER

**Definition:** Change at CER (constant exchanges rates) on total revenue excludes the effect of exchange rates by recalculating total revenue for the relevant period using the exchanges rates that were used for the comparable period.

**Reason to use:** The measure is important in order to understand the underlying performance of the operations and increases the comparability between periods.

Strategic portfolio
Definition: Includes Sobi's medicines Aspaveli/Empaveli, Doptelet excluding China, Gamifant, Vonjo and Zynlonta, and royalty on Sanofi's sales on Altuviiio and Beyfortus.
Reason to use: Focused list of medicines in the launch phase and key royalty income which contribute significantly to growth and the Sobi strategy: lead in Haematology, grow in Immunology, go global and capture the value of the pipeline. The development of the strategic portfolio is an important measure in order to understand the underlying performance and potential of the portfolio separate from matured medicines with lower growth.

Gross margin
Definition: Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue.
Reason to use: Gross margin is an important measure which provides a better understanding of the business development. Gross margin is impacted by several factors such as business, product and region mix and price developments.

Items affecting comparability
Definition: Items that are of significant value, have no clear connection to recurring, ordinary operations and are of such a type that they cannot be expected to occur often. This may, for example, refer to capital gains/losses from divestments, restructuring, impairments, other unusual one-time income/expenses and fair value adjustments. Restructuring refers to structural efficiency programmes that impact the scope of the business or other changes to business operations. Costs for carrying out restructuring are identified on a project basis and may be incurred over more than one year.
Reason to use: Provides a better understanding of the company's underlying operating activities.

Chronic liver disease, CLD | A liver disease becomes chronic when it has been present for more than 6-12 months without signs of resolution. Chronic liver disease can be inherited (genetic) or caused by a variety of factors such as viruses, auto-immunity, obesity and alcohol use.
Chronic refractory gout, CRG/Gout | Occurring especially in men, a disorder of purine metabolism characterized by fluctuating blood uric acid levels and sudden, severe recurrent acute arthritis, caused by the deposition of sodium urate crystals in connective tissues and joint cartilage.
Cold agglutinin disease, CAD | A rare autoimmune disorder characterised by the premature destruction of red blood cells (haemolysis). More specifically, CAD is a subtype of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. The disease is termed "cold" because the disease is active and cause haemolysis at cold temperatures, usually 3 to 4⁰C.
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, DLBCL | A form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and the most common blood cancer. Lymphomas occur when cells of the immune system, known as B-lymphocytes, grow and multiply uncontrollably. DLBCL occurs mostly in adults and is a fast-growing (aggressive) lymphoma.
Doptelet (avatrombopag) | An orally administrated thrombopoietin receptor agonist used in the treatment of thrombocytopenia by increasing platelet count.
Efanesoctocog alfa | A new factor VIII medicine designed to extend protection from bleeds with once-weekly prophylactic dosing for the treatment of haemophilia A. It adds a region of von Willebrand factor and XTEN® polypeptides to extend its time in circulation and is the first new factor VIII medicine to break through the von Willebrand factor ceiling. Efanesoctocog alfa is under regulatory review in Europe.
Elocta (efmoroctocog alfa) | A recombinant, extended half-life (EHL) clotting factor VIII medicine for the treatment of haemophilia A. It is also known as Eloctate in some countries.
Familial Mediterranean Fever, FMF | An autoinflammatory genetic disorder that mainly affects people of Mediterranean or Middle Eastern origin, characterised by recurrent episodes of fever and serositis (an inflammation in chest, abdomen, joints), leading to painful attacks early during childhood.
Full-time equivalents | A unit that indicates the workload of an employee in a way that makes it comparable.
Gamifant (emapalumab) | A monoclonal antibody medicine that binds to and neutralises interferon gamma for the treatment of ultra-rare syndromes of hyperinflammation.


## Haemophilia
A genetic bleeding disorder caused by insufficient levels of blood proteins, including factor VIII (haemophilia A) and factor IX (haemophilia B). Clotting factors are essential for proper clotting, the process by which blood clumps together to plug the site of a wound to stop bleeding. Haemophilia A occurs in about one in 5,000 male births annually, and haemophilia B occurs in about one in 25,000 male births annually. The product portfolio for haemophilia includes Alprolix and Elocta. Efanesoctocog alfa, a new medicine for haemophilia A, has been approved in the US under the brand name Altuviiio and is under regulatory review in Europe.

## Immune-complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, IC-MPGN and C3 glomerulopathy, C3G
Are complement-mediated renal diseases. Although IC-MPGN is considered a distinct disease from C3G, the underlying cause and progression of the two diseases are remarkably similar and include over-activation of the complement cascade, with excessive accumulation of C3 breakdown products in the kidney causing inflammation and damage to the organ. C3 is a protein within the complement cascade, a part of the body's immune system.

## Immune thrombocytopenia, ITP
An autoimmune disorder caused by low platelet count in the blood, leading to bruising and an increased risk of bleeding.

## Kineret (anakinra)
A recombinant protein medicine that blocks interleukin-1α and β by binding to interleukin-1 type 1 receptors. Interleukin-1 is a key mediator of inflammation and a significant contributor to autoinflammatory diseases, including several rare diseases.

## Macrophage activation syndrome, MAS
A severe and potentially fatal complication of rheumatic diseases, such as Adult-Onset Still's disease.

## Myelofibrosis
A rare type of blood cancer that causes scar tissue to form in the bone marrow. As the scar tissue builds up, it disrupts the body's normal production of blood cells.

## Orfadin (nitisinone)
A medicine used to treat hereditary tyrosinaemia type 1. It blocks the breakdown of tyrosine, thereby reducing the amount of toxic tyrosine by-products in the body. Patients must maintain a special diet in combination with Orfadin treatment as tyrosine is not adequately broken down. Orfadin can also be used for alkaptonuria.

## Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, PNH
A rare disorder in which red blood cells break apart prematurely. It is an acquired haematopoietic stem cell disorder. Some haematopoietic stem cells in individuals with PNH are defective and consequently produce defective blood cells. These defective red blood cells of PNH are extremely susceptible to premature destruction by a particular part of a person's own immune system called the complement system.

## Primary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, pHLH
A rare, life-threatening condition caused by an overactive, abnormal response of the immune system. In heamophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, the immune system responds to a stimulus or 'trigger', often an infection, but the response is ineffective and abnormal. Some affected individuals may have a genetic predisposition to developing haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. This is known as the primary or familial form.

## Respiratory syncytial virus, RSV
A common virus and the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in young children. The RSV season usually occurs from early autumn until late spring and peaks during the winter.

## SEL-212
A novel investigational combination therapy designed to reduce serum urate levels in people with chronic refractory gout. SEL-212 consists of pegadricase, co-administered with ImmTOR, designed to mitigate the formation of anti-drug antibodies.

## Still's disease
A rare systemic autoinflammatory disease characterized by fevers, rash, and joint pain. Still's disease includes Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) and Adult-Onset Still's disease (AOSD) which share symptoms but vary in frequency and presentation. A potentially fatal complication is macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).

## Strategic portfolio
Includes Sobi's medicines Aspaveli/Empaveli, Doptelet excluding China, Gamifant, Vonjo and Zynlonta, and royalty on Sanofi's sales on Altuviiio and Beyfortus.
