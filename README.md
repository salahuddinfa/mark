# Audit Report


To the Shareholders of Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited:


## I. Audit Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (hereinafter referred to as "CATL"), which comprise the consolidated and company balance sheets as of December 31, 2024, the consolidated and company income statements, the consolidated and company cash flow statements, and the consolidated and company statements of changes in shareholders' equity for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements.

We believe that the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated and company financial position of CATL as of December 31, 2024, and the consolidated and company results of operations and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises.


### II. Basis for Audit Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with the China Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the "Responsibilities of Certified Public Accountants for the Audit of Financial Statements" section of our report. We are independent of CATL in accordance with the Code of Ethics for Certified Public Accountants of China, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.


### III. Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.


### (I) Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets

For relevant information, please refer to "Section 10 Financial Report" - "V. Significant Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates" - "15. Property, Plant and Equipment, 17. Intangible Assets, 19. Impairment of Long-term Assets" and "Section 10 Financial Report" - "VII. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" - "16. Property, Plant and Equipment, 19. Intangible Assets".


# 1. Description of the Matter

As of December 31, 2024, the carrying amount of CATL's property, plant and equipment was RMB 112,589,053 thousand, and the carrying amount of intangible assets was RMB 14,419,804 thousand. During 2024, CATL recognized impairment losses on property, plant and equipment of RMB 3,214,322 thousand and on intangible assets of RMB 2,017,078 thousand. CATL assesses at the balance sheet date whether there is any indication that property, plant and equipment and intangible assets may be impaired. For those assets that are identified to be impaired, impairment tests are performed. If the recoverable amount of an asset or asset group is lower than its carrying amount, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss and charged to the income statement. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or asset group's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Due to the significant impact of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets on the financial statements and the significant management judgment involved in determining the impairment losses, we have identified the impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as a key audit matter.


# 2. Audit Procedures

(1) Evaluate and test the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls related to impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including the adoption of key assumptions and the review and approval of impairment losses;

(2) Obtain the management's identification of assets with impairment indications and assess the reasonableness of the asset group identification;

(3) Obtain relevant industry policies, inquire with relevant management personnel, understand the reasons for changes in the company's capacity utilization rate, and check whether the related machinery and equipment are idle;

(4) Perform physical inventory on the company's property, plant and equipment to verify whether the assets are consistent with the accounting records and check the actual operating status of the assets;

(5) Obtain the impairment test tables prepared by management for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with impairment indications and check the accuracy of the calculations;

(6) Review the appropriateness of the impairment test methods and models, key assumptions, and key parameters;
